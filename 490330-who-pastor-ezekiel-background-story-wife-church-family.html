He grew up in Rusinga Island, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Homabay County</a>, in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a>. He came from a poor background and was raised by his mother and grandfather.</p><p class=align-left>Ezekiel Odero started his education at the Ngodhe Island Primary School in Rusinga. However, due to his family's poor status, he usually went fishing at night – at his mother's urging – to supplement his family's income. The overnight activity significantly affected his studies, leading to poor performance at school. When he sat for his KCPE exams, he only managed 210 marks out of a possible 700.</p><p class=align-left>Ezekiel's grandfather, Daniel Odero, a former <a href=#>Kenya Wildlife Service</a> employee, moved with him to Seme in Kisumu, hoping to change his life. He enrolled him at Yeye Primary School, where he would focus on his studies. As a result, he passed when he re-sat his KCPE exams, which earned him admission to Miwani High School in Chemelil, Kisumu.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b565bf8c1cc81404.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eleni Giokos' husband, ethnicity, salary, family, CNN career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After four years at Miwani High School, Ezekiel sat for his KCSE examinations, scoring a mean grade of C. He then travelled to Mombasa, where he joined the Mombasa Polytechnic (now the Technical University of Mombasa), pursuing a course in Chemical Processing Technology. Unfortunately, he dropped out of the university in his second year due to financial problems.</p><p class=align-left>Ezekiel Odero was raised in a strict <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Christian family</a>. He attended the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, where he was in the choir. He also learned to play the keyboard at the church. His Christian background helped set him towards a career in the church ministry years later.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Pastor Ezekiel is rumoured to have worked in construction after moving to <a href=# rel=noopener>Mombasa</a> following his <a href=#>high school </a>studies. While at Mombasa, he also got involved with the Maximum Miracle Church, headed by Bishop Pius Muiru.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28c1683db1c388b2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Did Dr Phil divorce his wife?

During his tenure at the church, he became one of Bishop Muiru's spiritual children, and the preacher (Ezekiel) has revealed that he often turns to him when faced with a problem.</p><p class=align-left>While in Mombasa, Ezekiel Odero met Pastor Sarah, his future wife, who was looking for people to join her in opening a church. Seeing that they shared a similar vision, the two joined hands and opened their church, the New Life Church, in Shanzu.</p><p class=align-left>Over time, Pastor Ezekiel's church grew, becoming a huge attraction to Christian worshippers in Mombasa. However, after 15 years, the preacher moved his church from Shanzu to Mavueni, Kilifi county, his wife's village. He purchased a 65-acre parcel of land, where he built a<a href=#> mega-church</a> on 6.5 acres piece of the land, which is rumoured to have a capacity of 45,000 people.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b852b8c4acd9f937.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What really happened to James King from My-600-Lb Life?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Besides the church, Pastor Ezekiel has been constructing several other facilities on his purchased land.

He is also constructing a school and a university, cottages for church guests, a supermarket, restaurants, a hospital, and a <a href=#>rehab centre</a>.</p><h2>Wife and children</h2><p class=align-left>Pastor Ezekiel Odero is married to Pastor Sarah Odero, his wife and partner in his church ministry. The two met at Mombasa when Ezekiel was working as a mason. Their relationship blossomed into romance after spending time together, leading Ezekiel Odero to propose marriage.</p><p class=align-left>The start of their relationship was, however, anything but easy. Ezekiel Odero revealed that his family opposed the marriage and argued that Pastor Sarah – who dropped out of <a href=#>primary school</a> – was uneducated. However, he pressed on, insisting that he only saw her beauty and the love he had for her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62b3ae08cafc61e6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where is Dan Wheeler from QVC today?

At the time, the young pastor was still struggling, and he revealed how he could not afford much when he went to ask for his future wife's hand in marriage. Instead, he only took with him two goats and a Ksh 15 ring. At first, Sarah's family were reluctant but later agreed to the marriage.</p><p class=align-left>Ezekiel and Sarah Odero have been married for over ten years and have three children. Two of the children are their biological kids, while one son is adopted – after his brother's wife died giving birth. The couple and their children live in Mavueni, in the same compound where the pastor's church is.</p><h2>Net worth and earnings</h2><p class=align-left>What is Pastor Ezekiel's net worth? The New Life Church preacher is rumoured to be one of the <a href=#>richest pastors</a> in Kenya. While he has not revealed his exact net worth, his recent purchase of a 65-acre piece of land where he is constructing luxurious facilities is a sign of his wealth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/46f85a89bf022032.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sasha Czack, Sylvester Stallone's ex-wife life story and updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Recently, pictures of Pastor Ezekiel's house circulated online, which – alongside other buildings in his estate – are rumoured to be worth over Ksh 1 billion.
