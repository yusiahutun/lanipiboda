This is someone who listens to audio files of people talking and then types what’s being said for clients who want a text version. Thanks to the soaring popularity of videoconferences and podcasts, there’s a greater need for transcription services than ever before. And artificial intelligence (AI) software simply can’t transcribe these recordings as accurately as humans can. That’s because AI may not recognize accents, understand context or hear words correctly when multiple people are talking simultaneously. As a result, transcription services by real people are in big demand! Not only can you get started right away without any experience, but you’ll also be able to make your own hours by working right from home, thanks to these online transcription jobs&nbsp;for beginners.</p><p>(Click through to see more ways to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make money working from home</a>.)</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What does a general transcriptionist do?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/1-26.jpg><p>“General transcription is an awesome home-based career for three reasons,” points out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Mills</a>, founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Work at Home Mom Revolution</a> and author of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jump-Start Your Work at Home General Transcription Career</a>. “First, if you work with a company that assigns projects with a turnaround time, you pretty much work on your own schedule. I frequently worked at night after my children were in bed,” she recalls. “Second, you’ll never find a job with more variety. Every audio is different, and I’ve learned so much about an array of subjects over the years. Third, and most importantly, you can work from home and be your own boss! No one is looking over your shoulder.”</p><p>As a general transcriptionist, you’ll listen to audio files from a variety of sources (such as classes, focus groups, interviews, lectures, meetings, phone calls and podcasts) from a wide array of fields (such as education, entertainment, market research and media), says Mills. Some audio files may last just a few minutes, while others could last an hour or longer. Your job would be to listen to the audio file and type what you hear so that clients have a text version that’s accurate and has correct spelling and punctuation, explains Mills. On top of that, clients may have special requests, for example, to remove “filler” words like “um” and “uh”. The transcription company you work for may require certain formatting, such as including notation tags that point out when a section is inaudible due to loud noise (like a car honking).</p><p>As a beginner, it’s easier to break into the general transcription field since no special education, background or certification is needed. However, if you have a legal or medical background, you may be able to specialize in medical transcription (where you’d transcribe patient histories and medical reports) or legal transcription (where you’d transcribe court proceedings and depositions), explains Mills. That’s because you’re already familiar with terms that are unique to these professions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Do I need skills to do online transcription jobs&nbsp;for beginners?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/2-26.jpg><p>“The essential skills for a productive transcriptionist are a typing speed of at least 60 words per minute, excellent grammar and spelling, the willingness to research spellings and names you’re unfamiliar with, accuracy, the ability to follow directions to the letter, and a commitment to sticking to deadlines,” notes Mills. “Also very important is a good ear, which is something that you’ll acquire over time and with practice.”</p><p>What tools you’ll need for online transcription jobs for beginners? You’ll be listening to audio files and typing as you hear them, which means you’ll need the right tools that help you with these tasks. According to Mills, these include: “A desktop or laptop computer, a good pair of soundproof headphones, a foot pedal controller with USB connections, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Express Scribe software</a> (which handles downloaded audio and allows you to play it with your foot pedal), and Internet access.” Mills adds: “A recent version of Microsoft Word is a must. I also keep a list of common grammar rules posted by my desk.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s an online transcriptionist job for beginners like?</h2><p>“At the beginning of the week, you’ll send in a request for work, stating how many hours of audio you’d like to transcribe for the week, keeping in mind that each hour of audio takes about three hours to transcribe,” Mills states. “Once the work is uploaded to the company’s server, you’ll download it, listen to it to be sure it’s good audio, accept it, and then get started transcribing. After transcribing the audio and proofreading your work, you’ll want to give it a second listen. You’ll be surprised how much of the audio you’ll understand on the second run-through that you did not on the first run-through. This will help you fill in any blank spaces. When you’re sure your work is as accurate as possible, and you’ve researched to be sure all terms and names are correctly spelled, you’ll upload the audio back up to the server and get started transcribing the next audio.”</p><p>Some challenges that online transcription jobs for beginners entail: “The most common challenge people new to home transcription face is that at first, it’s overwhelming,” observes Mills. “When I started my first transcription job, I nearly quit. I couldn’t believe I was supposed to understand the audio, type it, stick to the guidelines and manage to make a living. But I persisted and gradually found it easier and easier. Also, as you do more jobs, you’ll learn new tips and tricks which will make you faster, allowing you to make more money per hour.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much do general transcriptionists earn?</h2><p>According to Indeed, you can earn between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$12.80 and $30.21 per hour</a> as a transcriptionist. The amount you’ll earn will vary based on the company or client, your typing speed, and which transcribing projects you select. Most freelance transcriptionists are paid by the “audio hour”, which means the length of time of the recording that you’re transcribing. So, if you earn $15 per audio hour, you’d earn $30 to transcribe a 2-hour recording. Keep in mind that it will take you longer to type the text than to simply listen to it without typing. So, the faster and more accurately you type, the more money you’ll earn. Using a foot pedal controller helps you cut transcription time by allowing you to easily speed up and slow down as needed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where can you find work-at-home transcription jobs?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/3-26.jpg><p>You can find remote general transcription jobs on trusted job boards, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlexJobs</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indeed</a>, and the <a href=#>Transcription Certification Institute. </a>You may also find them on freelancer platforms, such as <a href=#>Upwork</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiverr</a>. However, be aware that scammers have been posting fake ads on job boards and freelancer platforms posing as transcription service companies.

I quickly learned that the key to success is attention to detail, and I love the challenge!</p><p>“When my aunt, a court reporter, heard how happy I was with my side gig, she asked if I might want to work with her on projects too. With my youngest child starting school, the timing was perfect, and I added depositions and court proceedings to my repertoire.

I work at my own pace. The flexibility is what I love the most. I get to work at my own pace from home, and I’m able to be there when my kids need me.

So I emailed the owner to express my interest, and I was almost immediately hired.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I start a new project, I receive an audio or video file that I download. I then transcribe the speaker’s words into a Word document. I’ve transcribed so many interesting things from interviews for magazine and newspaper articles, books, documentaries, podcasts and even TV shows. I also transcribe files from roundtable discussions, conferences, market research studies and for college professors and students.</p><p>“I enjoy this work because every day is different, and I’m constantly learning something new. I also like that it’s flexible—I work between 15 and 40 hours a week, depending on my schedule, and can make as much as $485 a week.

After she shot the interviews, she sent me a digital audio and video file. I listened to the interviews and typed everything that was said in a format she provided. I also included time stamps in case she needed to go back to hear the audio. When I was done, she used the transcription to edit the film and add subtitles.”</p><p>“The pay ranges from 50 cents to $1 per minute of audio. I work as little or as much as I want and I set my own hours. I typically earn about $800 a month.&nbsp;Working as a transcriptionist has been such a great job for me.

It helps to be able to type fast, but the most important thing, is to have a quiet space to do the work since paying close attention to the audio is a priority. Of course, the faster you type, the more you earn — pay can range anywhere from $6 to $60 per hour. I type about 95 words per minute, so I can make $25 to $30 per hour. And if a job is more complicated, I get a higher rate.”</p><p>“At first I picked up occasional transcribing jobs when time allowed. But when my husband and I divorced a few years later, and I had to be the sole provider for my daughter and myself, transcribing was the perfect solution.
