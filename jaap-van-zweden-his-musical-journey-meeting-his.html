In orchestra rehearsals – at least ones I’ve attended over the years – there’s usually a faint, underlying soundtrack of exhalations, mur­murs, page rustles. With Van Zweden, it’s as if everyone has suspended breathing; what you hear, loudly, is the absolute silence. Once, he admonishes a musician: “You can talk at 4.30 until 9 o’clock tomorrow morning.” Other comments include, “You are not doing what I am asking” or “I’ve told you this before, by the way! I know that! I remember that!” or “Sloppy again on the last one”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2017/01/12/4f668ba8-d6f7-11e6-bbb7-6a43a6f882fe_660x385.JPG?itok=VjDGqqyp"><p datatype="p" class="c8 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197Gh data-qa=Component-Component>Occasionally, he makes a remark that triggers a slight ripple of what might be called amusement (or relief), but he’s no comedian. Sometimes, he sings from the libretto in German or he makes a distinctive clicking noise with his tongue, tock-tock-tock, like a human metronome. And then there are times when what he hears displeases him so much he, too, falls silent. He leans back on the podium as if summoning the strength to either go on or go ballistic. That’s a little scary.</p><p datatype="p" class="c9 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197JBI data-qa=Component-Component>What about the music? I’ve never heard Wagner before, apart from during the 1979 Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now, so my ability to make an informed comment is nil and my notes bear no relation to Herr Krafft’s. All they record is immediate emotion: “strings and horns creep into concert hall”; “goosebumps”; “concert hall trembling, or feels as if it is”; “JvZ’s compact vigour”; “frustration of interrupted climaxes”; “music encourages dread, wonder, expectation”; “such lovely, lovely, piercing music ...”</p><p datatype="p" class="c10 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197HwH data-qa=Component-Component>That occurs at the beginning of Act II Scene 2, when Siegfried, loitering in the forest outside a dragon’s cave, hears a bird singing. He tries to imitate it, fails, blows on his horn, awakens the dragon, kills it, tastes its blood and realises he can now understand birdsong. Perhaps it’s a metaphor for the artist’s constant struggle with creativity. I don’t know. But listening to Wagner’s music being perfected for an afternoon before interviewing the maestro feels like a blood-stirring, nerve-wracking, life-enhancing epiphany.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2017/01/12/5e56f3ca-d6f5-11e6-bbb7-6a43a6f882fe_660x385.JPG?itok=ViULbzAv"><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197lAB data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" class="c11 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197kEF data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">HOW DOES HE THINK THE REHEARSAL WENT?</strong> “I’m very happy,” replies Van Zweden, and pauses. His already evident qualities of deliberation and precision are further magnified by his careful Dutch accent. We’re in his dressing room, which isn’t exactly a cave but is unexpectedly basic and cramped. Luckily, the maestro has dispensed with two Hong Kong Phil members of staff who were also due to squeeze in for the duration of the interview.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197kYG data-qa=Component-Component>“The word ‘happy’ is, of course ... relative because we are not there yet,” he continues. “It’s wonderful to put the seed in the ground and I can see the flowers are growing fast with a lot of energy.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197sxH data-qa=Component-Component>The flowers, however, are tended by their gardener only intermittently. Van Zweden’s contract stipulates 14 weeks a year with the Hong Kong Phil. Does he notice a change after the inevitable gaps?</p><p datatype="p" class="c10 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197hpC data-qa=Component-Component>“The people in the orchestra know me so well. I like to be prepared and I like them to be prepared. If you start from that point, it’s always a great adventure. The orchestra is changing into a great box of diamonds and we need to shine them every day.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1010224701977XE data-qa=Component-Component>I’ve heard him make this very analogy before, but it was on a Texan digital-news channel and he was referring to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, for which he has been music director since 2008. (He will become its conductor laureate in 2018, when he goes to New York.) Perhaps, to him, all his orchestras are gems, and that jewel association makes me wonder if he could play a sort of aural version of Kim’s Game: if he were blindfolded and heard an identical piece of music played by the Hong Kong Phil, the New York Philharmonic and the Dallas Symphony, could he recall each detail sufficiently to tell them apart?</p><p datatype="p" class="c12 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197D7C data-qa=Component-Component>A much longer pause. He closes his eyes for a moment, internally listening. Then he says, “Yes. I remind myself every orchestra has its own soul, its own face, its own sound. And I’m talking also about the halls. An orchestra with its hall – this combination is a very important moment. You need a hall.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">If there’s one thing I want to say in this piece it’s that I’m so proud of this orchestra and they should be proud of themselvesJaap van Zweden</figure><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1010224701978vE data-qa=Component-Component>As it happens, the New York Philharmonic will be hall-less for at least 30 months during his tenure: the orchestra is scheduled to move out of the Lincoln Center in 2019 while the David Geffen Hall is being renovated. Does the upheaval make his appointment something of a poisoned chalice?</p><p datatype="p" class="noindent c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197DeB data-qa=Component-Component>“Not at all. First of all, before we leave, we’ll be in the hall for two more years. I also told you, a split second ago, an orchestra should create its own acoustic. The creation is stronger in a hall that’s not the greatest. They have an old soul and are strong enough to play here and there.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197gG data-qa=Component-Component>He’s looking forward to the outreach programme. “It gives us opportunities to play in the neighbourhoods,” he says. “That’s a big wish of me.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197xeG data-qa=Component-Component>New York is a familiar city: he went there in 1975, aged 15, to study the violin at Juilliard and lived in what was then called Spanish – now East – Harlem.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197bmE data-qa=Component-Component>“On 97th and Madison, not great,” he says. He’s picked up a biro and has started fiddling with it.

He doesn’t smoke, he doesn’t drink (“I never took one glass of wine, ever, in my life”) and he was, already, an intensely focused man. I’d read a story in a Dutch news­paper, via Google Translate, about how he’d met his wife, Aaltje, at a disco: he’d seen her dancing when he arrived and before they’d exchanged a single word, he’d told the doorman he was going to marry her.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197YkE data-qa=Component-Component>Is that true?</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1010224701971MF data-qa=Component-Component>“It was always like this,” he says. “I always trusted my eyes not only because she’s beautiful, which she is. I saw how she moved, I saw the grace, how she presented herself to others.” In another Dutch interview, Aaltje talked about her father, an alcoholic whom she’d feared. He’d died shortly before that night at the disco; perhaps what her future husband saw was need.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197LMI data-qa=Component-Component>“She was very open and very closed,” he says. “I saw she was hurt somehow. It was also very attractive to me to get to know her and find out why she was hurt.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c12 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197CID data-qa=Component-Component>Maybe that’s because he was hurt himself, I offer (cau­tious­ly), having lost his childhood when he went to Juilli­ard. Van Zweden considers this piece of pop psycho­logy for a generous amount of time, and acknowledges the possibility.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1010224701973vE data-qa=Component-Component>“Time heals,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197kt data-qa=Component-Component>In fact, the longer we talk, the more engaged he appears to become. His eyes grow bright; once, discussing the horrors of jet lag (“That’s my opponent”), he gives a lovely, throaty laugh. I ask him why he only wears black.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197PxB data-qa=Component-Component>“The other day someone told me Steve Jobs also is like this,” he replies. “I read about some people who are quite successful but I would say get nervous of certain things. There is an autistic element.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c12 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1010224701972fD data-qa=Component-Component>Two bottles of Bonaqua water have been placed on the dressing table in the little room.

I can say yes. Certain things needed to be in order. With the violin ... before going on stage, I always did a few things. There was a certain cloth I wore under my chin; if I didn’t have it, I would drive back and get it. I did not get nervous. I just liked the pattern of certain things.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197gwH data-qa=Component-Component>The conversation, as we both know, is heading in one direction (“It’s OK, there’s nothing wrong with that,” he remarks kindly) because the Van Zwedens’ third child, Benjamin, now 24, is severely autistic. It took a while for the diagnosis; Aaltje has spoken, memorably, of the inexplicable screaming, the excrement smeared on walls.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197ieF data-qa=Component-Component>“You wonder what’s going on,” Van Zweden says. “You sit, sometimes, at home and you’re devastated. We went to America and, finally, it gets a shape. Then, gradually, he is transformed. There is a saying in Dutch: the heaviness changes into wings. And now we’re flying.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We truly think it’s wonderful to earn money but even more to give it awayJaap van Zweden</figure><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197X2F data-qa=Component-Component>The flight metaphor is apt. In 1995, they set up the Foundation Benjamin, which has since become the Papageno Foundation – Papageno, the bird catcher, being another opera character (from Mozart’s The Magic Flute) with an avian connection. The emphasis is on music therapy. In 2015, Queen Máxima of the Netherlands attended the opening of Papageno House, a residence for young autistic adults, including Benjamin, in Laren, on the outskirts of Amsterdam.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197mf data-qa=Component-Component>“We truly think it’s wonderful to earn money but even more to give it away,” Van Zweden says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/237x147/public/images/methode/2017/01/12/dd5c4e48-d7a6-11e6-bbb7-6a43a6f882fe_237x147.JPG?itok=GYCHEwSc"><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1010224701974SF data-qa=Component-Component>It’s fortunate, then, his income is so considerable. Last June it was revealed that, in 2013, his salary with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra was US$5.1 million. It transpired that US$3.3 million was a one-off signing bonus – a gift from a single individual – which tells you something about music lovers in the United States. (After the story broke, The Dallas Morning News took the bovine, rather than the avian, route with the headline “Holy cow! Jaap van Zweden was one well-paid dude at the Dallas Symphony Orchestra”.) The orchestra’s spokesman stated later that Van Zweden had immediately decided to use the bonus for its benefit.</p><p datatype="p" class="c12 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197FtB data-qa=Component-Component>But, like a bird, it is Papageno he must follow.

Since he was a little boy, we went to the circus.” I had a reason for the question: Aaltje had first noticed a vigorous early response to music while their son was listening not to Wagner but to George Michael. (Benjamin threw a toy train at her upon hearing Jesus to a Child because, he later explained, it made him sad.) The maestro of three orchestras couldn’t bring himself to tell his son the British pop singer had died.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197MLG data-qa=Component-Component>While looking through Van Zweden’s résumé, I was struck by the decade-long gap between his first appearance as a conductor in the US – in St Louis, in 1996 – and his second, in 2006, with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. I thought the reason might have been Benjamin’s condition. But no.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197wMF data-qa=Component-Component>“It was a tryout, actually, in St Louis – my first little steps.

Afterwards, while he was learning to conduct, Van Zweden kept up his violin playing but, in 1998, he suddenly – from one day to the next – closed down that part of himself. He didn’t want a safety net if his conducting failed.</p><p datatype="p" class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101022470197tkF data-qa=Component-Component>“Everyone was shocked but, you see, when you walk on stage with a violin at the age of seven, you walk on with your history – your teachers, your parents, your grandparents – and conducting felt like a liberation.
