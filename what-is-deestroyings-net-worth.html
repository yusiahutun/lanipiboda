In 2017, the NCAA&nbsp; told him to delete his YouTube channel if he wanted to stay on the UCF football team, despite his University being okay with it.</p><p>The NCAA asked him to delete his channel because it forbids its athletes from profiting off their athletic abilities aside from their scholarships.&nbsp;</p><p>Faced with this dilemma, Deestroying ultimately chose to continue his channel instead of playing for the University of Central Florida. Since quitting the team, the YouTuber has amassed 4.74 million subscribers.</p><h2>Here Are Some Facts About Deestroying</h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Net Worth:</strong></td><td>$5.59 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession:</strong></td><td>Youtuber</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality:</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth:</strong></td><td>December 2, 1996</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Place of Birth:</strong></td><td>Limón, Costa Rica</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height:</strong></td><td>5 ft 9 in (175 cm)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight:</strong></td><td>171 lb (78 kg)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alma Mater:</strong></td><td>University of Central Florida</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Real Name:</strong></td><td>Donald De La Haye Jr.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Style:</strong></td><td>Sports, Vlogs & Comedy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Videos:</strong></td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Subscribers:</strong></td><td>4.74M</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Yeas Active:</strong></td><td>2015 - Present</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=how-much-is-deestroying-n>Deestroying's Net Worth Is Approximately $5.59 Million</h2><p>The YouTuber Deestroying has an estimated net worth of about $5.59 million as of 2022.</p><p>He makes his income primarily from his Youtube channel, which has amassed 4.74 million subscribers as of 2022.

They are as follows:</p><ul><li>Sports Challenges: These videos demonstrate Deeestroying's kicking abilities alongside bizarre kicking-related stunts. The videos also feature fellow Youtubers, his friends, or his girlfriend.&nbsp;</li><li>NFL players are like: These videos show Deestroying satirically impersonating NFL players like:<ul><li>Odell Beckham Jr</li><li>Baker Mayfield</li><li>Jalen Ramsay, and</li><li>JuJu Smith-Schuster, to name a few</li></ul></li><li>Football Players be like: These videos show Deestroying doing comedic mini-skits on stereotypes of each position in football</li><li>Vlogs: These videos display his normal, day-to-day life and have now been moved to his new channel</li><li>Story Times: These videos show Deestroying sharing some of the most bizarre incidents in his football career and personal life.

This amount is after the company takes its cut. The company pays more depending on how long people stick around and watch the videos.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/5572f10a-60bd-4c6d-897b-5d59cce351c9.webp></p><p>Deestroying benefits here because he makes high-energy videos that clock in under 30 minutes, making them ideal for Youtube's conditions. It is estimated that Deestroying makes $1.4 million a year through YouTube just out of AdSense. Also, he has been averaging a million views at a minimum on each of his videos. Looking at the numbers, one can understand how the Youtuber has been making mad money.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, there are sponsorships, which the Youtuber has never been shy about using. As he is an athletics-related channel, he receives a lot of athletic-related sponsorships.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the amount of income he receives from these sponsorships is not information, he has divulged to his fans and the public, suffice it to say that the Youtuber has made enough to live a comfortable life.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/5d8a6f13-7f58-4852-9ce7-ff2e08e4303f.webp></p><p>But comfort is not what Deestroying is looking for. He is a phenom in content creation and has expanded out of YouTube into Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, and he has a large following in each.</p><p>He has 99.6K followers on his Twitter. Unsurprisingly, he uses Twitter less for publicizing and just as a normal person. He has two million followers on his Instagram, which is more active. He posts stills and videos from his training and videos.</p><p>By far, his most popular social media app outside of Youtube is TikTok, where he has four million followers and has amassed 92.5 million likes. He posts similar content on TikTok as his Youtube but is more fast-paced.</p><h2>Deestroying's Career Earnings</h2><p>Strictly looking at the views from his main channel, Deestroying has earned roughly $10,241,275.</p><p>This amount is derived from his total view count, which is 853,439,641, calculated against the $2-$12 rate that Youtube pays. However, the amount is also assumed that Deestroying's videos earn $12 instead of any other amount from that scale.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/70dadf86-4ec6-41e9-a3de-c0e1dbd2aede.webp></p><p>Then there is also the question of the Youtuber's second channel, More Deestroying. He started this channel on November 15, 2020, and uploaded his first video a couple of days later, on November 19, 2020.</p><p>Since then, he has released 29 videos on the channel. The highest viewed video on the channel has 4.1 million views.&nbsp;</p><p>The five most viewed videos on the channel are:</p><table style=border-collapse:collapse;width:100% border=1><tbody><tr><td>Title</td><td>Views</td></tr><tr><td>MY GRANDPA (TYREEK HILL) IS RACING STRANGERS FOR $1000!!</td><td>4.1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE DID THIS DARE!!</td><td>1.2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>I Pulled Up On Cam Newton & The Patriots For a Workout...</td><td>1.1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>MEET MY NEW GIRLFRIEND...</td><td>1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Seeing My Ex For The First Time In 2 Years...</td><td>937K</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As evident from the list, the second channel focuses more on vlogging and the Youtuber's personal life. The channel has amassed 17,176,575 total views.</p><p>Taking the views of the second channel into account, the Youtuber has earned $206,118 in total.</p><p>Then there is also the question of his sponsorships and paid promotions. Suffice it to say that the Youtuber has earned quite a pretty penny in his career.</p><h2 id=deestroying-girlfriend-is>Deestroying's Girlfriend: Is He In A Relationship With Kiana Wudte?</h2><p>No, Deestroying is not in a relationship with Kiana Wudte, though he dated her for a long time.</p><p>Kiana Wudte is also a YouTuber and has a channel with over 403K subscribers. Her content mostly revolves around vlogging, fitness, and some sports.&nbsp;</p><p>She and Deestoying dated from the summer of 2017 until 2020 when they broke up. They posted the reasoning behind the break-up on Kiana's channel in a video called "The truth about our relationship..."</p><p>After Deestroying and Kiana's relationship ended, Kiana started using her channel less and less. The reason was that the channel was supposed to be for their couple's adventures.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/5c874193-06a3-4bc0-9fa4-1cf8dc1fc51c.webp></p><p>However, she is very active on Instagram, with 115K followers. She also has a TikTok, where she has 284.2K followers. Half a year after Deestroying and Kiana Wundte broke up, Deestroying started dating fellow Youtuber and former Division 1 women's basketball player <strong>Lauren Fitzmaurice.</strong></p><p>Fitzmaurice went by Lolo Fitzmo online and joined <a href=# rel=noopener>Youtuber </a>on June 30, 2021. She has since amassed 184K subscribers.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/aed5f655-3b64-4f51-8832-61a81dd9d000.webp></p><p>She has 195K followers on her Instagram and 637.1K on her TikTok. Deestroying introduced her to his fans on his second channel, More Deestroying, in a video called "MEET MY NEW GIRLFRIEND..." uploaded on August 19, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, their relationship would not last that long as he released another video called "we broke up" on February 24, 2022. He has been single ever since.</p><h2 id=what-is-deestroying-real->What Is Deestroying's Real Name?</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/73604c9e-d0ee-45fa-8bff-ed195c788f29.webp></p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTuber </a>Deestroying's real name is <strong>Donald De La Haye Jr.</strong></p><p>His family immigrated from Costa Rica when the young boy was only seven years old. He spent his youth in Port St. Lucie, Florida.&nbsp;</p><p>He was into football from a young age, and this interest led to him joining the University of Central Florida's football team as their kickoff specialist. He stayed in the position from 2015 to 2016 until his forced removal.</p><p>The YouTuber also played as a wide receiver. While at the University of Central Florida, De La Haye Jr studied marketing and was a marketing major. He is currently a member of the e-sports and entertainment team, FaZe Clan.</p><h2 id=who-are-deestroying-paren>Who Are Deestroying's Parents?</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/b5f5f2ab-5091-4f8b-a3b3-d011ca4fd2a6.webp></p><p>Deestroying's parents are his father, Donald, and his mother, Sheron De La Haye.</p><p>Not much is known about his parents except their immigration. Deestroying has tried hard to keep his<a href=# rel=noopener> YouTube career</a> and personal life separated.</p><p>The most his fans have known about him is his relationships but that too in brief glimpses. As his relationship with Kiana Wundte became hampered through his social media life, it's understandable why Deestroying would take extra steps to ensure his life is compartmentalized.</p><p>With no relationships to distract him, and only his career on his mind, the Youtuber has been grinding away on his channel. His forthrightness is showing because each of his videos from the last three months has passed a million views minimum. Though he isn't anywhere closer to the NFL than when he started, the Youtuber has a great career and is making a lot of money. So, he's thriving.&nbsp;</p><h2>Some FAQs</h2><h3 class=m-0>Is Deestroying Dating Kiana Wundte?</h3>No, they broke up in 2020<h3 class=m-0>Why Did The NCAA Kick Out Deestroying?</h3>They kicked him out because he had a Youtube Channel<h3 class=m-0>What Is Deestroying's Real Name?</h3>His real name is Donald De La Haye Jr<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecOenKysoqTGqrrGrGSnnaRixLC%2B06E%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./541288-famous-female-country-singers-1990s-top-songs.html>&#171;&nbsp;15 famous female country singers of the 1990s with their top songs</a>
