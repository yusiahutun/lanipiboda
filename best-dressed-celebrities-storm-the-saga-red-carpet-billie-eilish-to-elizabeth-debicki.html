The 30th edition of the awards were the first following the SAG-AFTRA strikes which brought the showbiz industry to a standstill. The 118-day strike ended in November last year.</p><p>Los Angeles’ Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall hosted writers, producers, directors and actors for the star-studded event this weekend, and the SAGA Red Carpet deserves a shout-out.</p><p>Celebrities were invited to celebrate the best performances, writing and technical talent over the past year.</p><p>While it may be different to other events, say the <a href=#>Oscars</a> or Golden Globes, there’s no official host. Instead Idris Alba opened the ceremony, which was streamed on <a href=#>Netflix</a>.</p><p>He also brought up the elephant in the room (the strike): “It is especially meaningful to be here with us all together to for this occasion after going through a very difficult time with the strike.</p><p>“I want to take this moment to honour and appreciate all of you both here and watching at home who stood up for SAG-AFTRA in solidarity and support.

Of course, this is in honor of her <a href=#>Barbie</a> movie in which she was up for a statue. But it’s not the first time, she’s clearly chosen to be fierce in fashion pink this year to celebrate the <a href=#>movie</a>.</p><p>The 33-year-old’s Schiaparelli gown dazzled in front of flashing cameras.</p><p>The star was up for three nominations this year, including with the film. She lost out on Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role against Lily Gladstone. Gladstone took home the award for her part in Killers of the Flower Moon.</p><p>Barbie was also up for Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture (won by Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning), Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture (Oppenheimer won). The other Barbie nod was for <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>, for Male Actor in a Supporting Role, which Robert Downey Jr took home.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ali-wong>Ali Wong</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2028798532-1024x717.jpg><p>The Beef star was channeling a beautiful peacock with her statement dress.</p><p><a href=#>Ali Wong</a> says her stylist’s assistant ‘fell to the floor’ in awe over her SAGA Red Carpet look.</p><p>Tara Swennen said: “I have a pretty good game face. I try and let my clients have an emotion before I show mine. All of my assistants and I just gasped the moment she put it on”.</p><p>And we can see why.</p><p>The star was up for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series and won. She was up against stars from Lessons in Chemistry, A Small Light, Tiny Beautiful Things as well as Painkiller.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-halle-bailey-brings-the-little-mermaid-to-the-saga-red-carpet>Halle Bailey brings The Little Mermaid to the SAGA Red Carpet</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2036940264-683x1024.jpg><p>Ariel who? Halle Bailey’s take on a mermaid look for the SAGA Red Carpet is definitely on trend.</p><p>The fashionista looked radiant in a burgundy skintight strapless gown, which featured a mermaid tail skirt. Stunning is an understatement.</p><p>The star had recently given birth, and although fans accused the star of <a href=#>secretly hiding her pregnancy</a>, she appeared to clap back at the haters when it came to the event.</p><p>The 23-year-old looked incredible, with her hourglass figure being the main element of the sheer and corset-style bodice. She accessoriZed the look with a sparking, silver necklace.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-eilish>Billie Eilish</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2037029580-683x1024.jpg><p>Although her antics on stage caught attention – signing Melissa McCarthy’s face with a sharpie on stage – her look stood out too. Whilst most stars may feel obliged to put on the biggest gowns with statement features, she stays true to her style.</p><p><a href=#>Billie Eilish</a> went for a preppy vest alongside her brother Finneas O’Connell. The 22-year-old wore black, loose-fitting trousers, a white shirt which was undone at the bottom. The Ocean Eyes hitmaker layered a sheer, tan vest that had red trim, as well as a black tie for the collar.</p><p>Her hair was in an up-do, and her makeup natural.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taraji-p-henson-brought-elegance-to-the-saga-red-carpet>Taraji P Henson brought elegance to the SAGA Red Carpet</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2028794686-1024x717.jpg><p>Can we just take a minute for Taraji P Henson please?</p><p>Her stunning and elegant black gown had something about it, and she oozed Hollywood glamor.</p><p>The strapless fitted gown, by Giambattista Valli, had a floor-length train, and The Color Purple star wore Bulgari jewelry to make it sparkle. She paired it with a Judith Leiber clutch and Betsey Johnson heels.</p><p>Gorgeous.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pedro-pascal>Pedro Pascal</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2028798564-717x1024.jpg><p>Simple and yet rocks the best-dressed on the SAGA Red Carpet this year.</p><p><a href=#>Pedro Pascal</a>, who choked up on stage after winning Outstanding Perfomance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series, rocked a white shirt, with the top buttons unfastened, and black trousers.</p><p>Who needs a jacket? Practical and stylish and true Pedro style for the <a href=#>TV</a> star.</p><p>Although he did admit he had a little bit too much to drink by the time he got onto the stage, but we forgive him for that.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-elizabeth-debicki>Elizabeth Debicki</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2028798374-717x1024.jpg><p>The Diana star was nominated for her role in <a href=#>The Crown</a>, but her Red Carpet look at SAGA was definitely a win.</p><p>The 33-year-old wore a pale blue sequin and lace gown that was backless. The custom Armani Prive dress had mesh panels, shimmering overlay as well as a jewel encrusted neckline.</p><p>It gave the appearance it was part of her skin as the sheer straps melted away, and she was the perfect ice queen.</p><p>Elizabeth Debicki was up for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series for The Crown, and she took it home. She appeared to look absolutely stunned her name was called out and was in a trance as she walked up to the stage.</p><p>You’ve got this Elizabeth.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eCcK7ErKtmnKKawLSxw2aanqSVl7%2BqwMieqmarpKS%2FrnnToZxmq5Gcrm6%2BxJ1knJmipbK1ecGio6WhlWKyqrjIrJ9mrJ9isq212ZqZnqyYYrGmrsicoqJn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./liddy-clark-i-hope-you-dance-cover-lee-ann-womack.html>&#171;&nbsp;Hear Liddy Clark's Revival of Lee Ann Womack's 'I Hope You Dance'</a>
