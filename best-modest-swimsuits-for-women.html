And while we firmly believe that all bodies are beach bodies and there are no such thing as “problem areas,” it’s also empowering to be able to choose what parts of your body you want to show off (or not!) in your swimsuit. Below, we’ve rounded up the best, modest swimwear, including slimming one-pieces, swim tops and bottoms (hello swim leggings!), and even less-than-revealing bikinis and tankinis.</p><p>So whatever your age and body type, we can guarantee there is a figure-flattering, modest bathing suit style you’ll actually love wearing. Bonus: the more coverage you choose, the more sun protection!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where can I buy a cute modest swimsuit?</h2><p>So many brands specialize in modest swimwear that is inclusive to all sizes and bodies. The <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Bare Necessities swim collection</a> features beautiful swim dresses and skirted suits. <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">ModLi</a> is one of the only brands out there that specializes in <a href=# rel=noopener>swim leggings and longer swim shorts</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Summersalt</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Swimsuits For All</a> are two fan-favorite swimwear brands that are designing modest one-pieces and tankinis in just about every size.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best swimsuit to hide a tummy?</h2><p>If you want to hide a tummy, shop for <a href=# rel=noopener>shapewear swimsuits with tummy control</a>, or invisible piping that creates a Spanx-like effect on your midsection. Miraclesuits (<a href=# rel=noopener>available at Macys</a>), are popular for their magical ability to make you look 10 pounds lighter — the style of this Miraclesuit Tramonto Belle Temptation Underwire One-Piece (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">$184, Macys</a>) proves what a great cut and print can do for your waistline. You can also find flowy swim tops and tankinis (<a href=# rel=noopener>like this colorful Amazon tankini</a>) that are less restricting but accomplish the same goal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is considered a modest swimsuit?</h2><p>It really depends on your body type. Here’s the best modest coverage swimwear for each shape:</p><ul><li><strong>Pear shape: </strong>For those with larger legs and butts who want to conceal their lower half, look for full-coverage bottoms, <a href=#>swim leggings</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>shorts</a>, and swim skirts that flare. And while you may not be looking to bare much cleavage, you can still consider a modest swim stop that boasts a flattering neckline to draw attention upward.</li><li><strong>Apple shape: </strong>Apples, or those with larger busts and narrower hips, may want cleavage-coverage swimsuits that leave extra room for the tummy. Bold-print tops and ruffled tankinis look great on this body type!</li><li><strong>Hourglass shape: </strong>Those who have curves look great in one-pieces and swim dresses that cinch at the waist, or high-waisted bikinis. Just make sure to choose a <a href=#>full-coverage swim top</a> for ample cleavage control.</li><li><strong>Straight shape: </strong>Straight shapes are pretty proportionate, but don’t tend to have one particular asset that “pops.” Swim skirts that flare, wrap-style one-pieces, and swimsuits with ruffles can create curves without showing too much skin.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More flattering swimsuits for women:</h2><p>Still looking for more swimwear options?

It’s nearly impossible for me to find clothes that fit correctly, particularly swimwear. I’m not disillusioned about my figure. I’m a big girl. But I deserve to rock a bikini like the best of them. I love this suit. Coverage is great. The top hangs as low as the pictures suggest, and leave enough skin where I still feel like I’m wearing a bikini.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Miraclesuit Sunset Cay Peephole Wireless Tankini Swim Top</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best Shapewear Two-Piece Tankini Waist Cincher</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/best-shapewear-swimsuits-4-1.png><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy at Amazon, starting at $86.80</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li><span style=font-size:1rem;text-indent:2rem>Padded, wire-free cups</span></li><li><span style=font-size:1rem;text-indent:2rem>Adjustable straps</span></li><li>Vibrant print</li></ul><p>For a two-piece shapewear swimwear set with a little more pizzaz, get the Sunset Cay keyhole tankini top with the solid super high-waist tankini bottoms.
