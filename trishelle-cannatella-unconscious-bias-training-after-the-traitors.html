But with no proof ... people have to rely on the biases that they bring into the game, which end up targeting whoever's the most different from the group," she said. "And in those situations, people like me don't really fare that well."</p><p>Saying it reminded her of her early high school experience as the only out LGBTQ person, she then pointed to all the anti-trans legislation in the country and said her being on the show was "bigger than me just coming to play a game." Peppermint added, "Most people don't know someone who's trans in their personal life, which means that they learn about how to interact with us from TV. And so I was heartbroken that I wasn't able to see that through a little longer."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>On <a href=#>#WWHL</a> Andy asked Trishelle if she thought Dorit and Garcelle had a path forward on <a href=#>#RHOBH</a></p><p>She then shared she was going to take Unconscious Bias classes herself and Dorit could benefit from them too.

But I would like to get an actual coach," shared Trishelle.

I see you. I understand the anger and frustration I caused and I promise I will come out better from this," she wrote. "Seeing some of the comments made me realize I have some work to do that I didn't even realize at the time but I do now. So thank you."</p><p>She also insisted that her decision didn't come from a PR team -- which she said she doesn't even have -- before hitting back at someone who said she didn't do anything wrong during her time on The Traitors.</p><p>"I appreciate your defense but this is literally the mindset that I want to get away from," she wrote. "It's more about how other people feel in this moment and things we don't realize that contribute to their feelings. That's what I want to work on."</p><p>In an interview after the finale with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Parade</strong></a>, Trishelle said she agreed with everything Peppermint said during the reunion and added that, going forward, she would "see people as a whole and not just the competition."</p><p>She also told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Daily Beast</strong></a> that she and Peppermint spoke after the reunion, but didn't want to get into the specifics of that conversation out of respect to the Drag Race star; she added she's ready and willing to have a more in-depth conversation with her whenever she's ready to talk.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmam1fqb%2Bqv8eeo6WdXZiur7rArZylpJFiwq%2BvzqeqnKGfqsBursiaqmasopa2r7XNoGSanqSav27Ax55kraqRnsGwvtJo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./janine-girardi.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Janine Girardi dating?
