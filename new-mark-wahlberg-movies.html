I was always the young guy trying to fit in with the crowd and I was easily influenced.

He has also ventured into producing. He said, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The reason why I started producing</a> was because I didn’t want to sit around waiting for Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise or whoever was already established to go and pass on a movie until I could get my hands on it. I was always proactive in trying to find material and things that I could produce, that I knew was right for me, create my own destiny.” In addition to acting and producing, Wahlberg found success in business endeavors.</p><p>In his personal life, Mark Wahlberg is married to model <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rhea Durham</a>, and together they have four children.

He says, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">They know that Dad can’t start the day without being in prayer</a>, can’t start the day without reading my Scripture or going to Mass. And hopefully, instead of forcing that on them, they’ll say, ‘Well, if it works for Dad, maybe it’ll work for us,’ and they’ll kind of gravitate towards it on their own.”</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Real Life Movies on Netflix, Ranked: 10 Stories That Are Sure to Inspire</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>New Mark Wahlberg movies: Infinite (2021)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Infinite follows a man haunted by memories of past lives who discovers his true identity as a member of a secret society tasked with saving humanity from destruction.
