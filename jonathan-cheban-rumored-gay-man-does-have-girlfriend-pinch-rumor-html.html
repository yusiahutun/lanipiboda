Kim and Jonathan have been best friends for a decade, but his absence in Kim K's social media has made people question if the two are still friends.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kim Kardashian And Jonathan's Decade Long Friendship&nbsp;</h2><p>Cheban, famous for his nickname Foodgod has been friends with the&nbsp;Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kim Kardashian since the two met at a friend's birthday party. Since then, the duo has remained best friends, and Johnathan is also a major member of the show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, he has not made a&nbsp;constant appearance in both the show and Kim's social media, raising&nbsp;many eyebrows about their friendship. However, it all seems to be baseless rumors as the duo did take a vacation together in 2019, and Jonathan also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a video with Kim on her birthday.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The caption read-&nbsp;</p><p>KIM...Happy Birthday to the most awesome and amazing best friend anyone could ask for! I hope you know how much I love and appreciate you!! I am so happy we have been able to spend countless times laughing and growing! You have grown into a legend! You’re not just my best friend, You’re the best Period!!! Love you so much!! Foodgod (stop calling me Jonathan)</p><p>Also, Jonathan uploaded a picture with Kim and her kids being&nbsp;part of the Halloween family costume.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Jonathan with Kim and her children</strong> (Source- Jonathan's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Jonathan Gay? His Sexuality Revealed</h2><p>The whole speculation about Jonathan being gay ignited&nbsp;when Kris Humphries,&nbsp;Kim's then-fiance, questioned Cheban's manhood. His logic was simple as&nbsp;he said-</p><p>"Wait, you’re straight but you’ve never wanted to sleep with Kim? Impossible!"</p><p>That statement spread like wildfire, and ever since, people have been raising their eyebrows regarding his sexuality. However, despite&nbsp;the gay speculations, his relationship history shows something different. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Cheban formerly had a girlfriend named Anat Popovsky, which&nbsp;smacked&nbsp;down&nbsp;all the speculations of him being gay. Anat and Cheban began dating in the year 2013 and had made various public appearances with each other.</p><p>According to the&nbsp;source, things were going smoothly, and they were getting so serious that even Kim was okay with Anat dating her BFF. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">source</a> stated-</p><p>"Lately, things have been getting serious. They're together all the time. Where he goes, she goes. Kim has met her and really likes her—and she's very picky when it comes to who dates her best friend!"</p><p>But, they split after a year in April 2014 because of some ups and downs in their relationship. However, as per sources, Cheban was missing Anat and wanted to give the relationship a second go. &nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p><strong>Anat Popovsky and Jonathan&nbsp;Cheban </strong><strong>saw</strong><strong> holding hands in public </strong>(Photo: dailymail.com)</p><p>Finally, Cheban and Anat reconciled in October 2015 just to split for the final time in&nbsp;August 2016. The reason behind their split is reported to be the fact that Cheban left Anat at home and ended up partying with other models.</p><p><strong>Don't Miss</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Victor Garber & Husband Now; Gay Couple Still In Love Or Struggling?" rel=follow>Victor Garber & Husband Now; Gay Couple Still In Love Or Struggling?</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Just three days after the break-up, he was spotted with the beauty Corinne Olympios. But, that was the start of a new relationship for FoodGod. Soon, he stirred another rumor on 7 January 2019 when he was spotted coming out of the C restaurant in London with a Kardashian lookalike.</p><p>The beautiful lady was wearing a stunning black dress, and Cheban matched her outfit with a black dress up of his own. Though the food lover did not reveal any information about the girlfriend, the two looked very good together.&nbsp;</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Jonathan Cheban captured with a new lady in his life </strong>(Photo: dailymail.co.uk) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And over time, their relationship also slowly faded away.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You May Also Like</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Yungblud Age 20 & Halsey Romance, New Girlfriend?

This is, however, not because of the reality star's lack of&nbsp;trying.</p><p>Since his split from&nbsp;ex-girlfriend Anat, Jonathan has been in a dating sprint of a sort. With the hopes of getting married one day, he has given "dating to get married" a new meaning by enjoying the company of beautiful women. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Read Also</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Openly Gay Stephen Fry Half Age Husband; Massive Gap Helps Or Strains?" rel=follow>Openly Gay Stephen Fry Half Age Husband; Massive Gap Helps Or Strains?</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>After calling it quits with his ex-girlfriends, the 47-year-old former publicist was photographed with a mysterious brunette in Florida.</p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Jonathan with a mystery woman </strong>(Photo:- dailymail.co.uk)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Then in March 2018, Jonathan was once again pictured with his alleged on and off boo&nbsp;Corinne Olympios enjoying dinner dates at Craig's and lunch at II Pastaio&nbsp;the following week.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-625 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Jonathan pictured with Corinne</strong> (Photo:- dailymail.co.uk)</p><p><strong>Discover</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Daniel Henney Thoughts On Getting Married, Ideal Wife & Dating Talks" rel=follow>Daniel Henney Thoughts On Getting Married, Ideal Wife & Dating Talks</a></p><p>Contrary to gossips that suggested that the pair might be dating, the FoodGod and Bachelor In Paradise Alum are very good friends at best. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-626 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A month after his alleged date with Corine, Jonathan was once again seen enjoying the company of another mystery woman.
