The couple has three daughters together: Alexia (born 1996), Sophia (born 2000), and Portia (born 2008). Kyle was four months pregnant with Alexia when they married. “The wedding was originally going to be, I believe, in April, and then we moved it up to January so my dress would still fit because I was pregnant,” Richards told&nbsp;The Knot. “I don’t believe in getting married again or a vow renewal because we got it right the first time and I just don’t want to mess with what works,” she said.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Erika-Jayne.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ERika-Jayne.jpg><p>Speaking to People about their 20+ marriage in 2015, Kyle said,&nbsp;“I grew up in a divorced family, and I had a very different upbringing. Now I have a husband I’m in love with who I’m excited to see every day and kids who are together and really tight,” she said. “Last night I was laughing because we were all in the bathroom, and my husband says, ‘Who wants to cut my hair?’ All of a sudden three girls are fighting over the scissors. I love those moments.”</p><p>For Mauricio’s part, he gushed about <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1082036/real-housewives-lessons-men/ rel="noreferrer noopener">their dynamic.</a> “We’re best friends.

No, Kyle Richards did not cheat on Mauricio with Morgan Wade, there hasn’t been infidelity on either side.</p><p>In the finale of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, which aired on February 21, 2024, Kyle teared up as she talked&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">about her separation from Mauricio</a>. She reiterated that cheating had nothing to do with their split.</p><p>“There’s literally nothing to do with anybody else,” she told her co-star, Erika Girardi. “This is really just about Mo and me. It’s not about our family. It’s not about external family. It’s not about another person –&nbsp;on his side or my side. This is just about Mo and me.”</p><p>She hinted that they may have grown apart, explaining: “When we first met, we were really opposites. Complete opposites. And that worked. I always would joke and say – if it wasn’t for me, he would be dead, because I keep him safe. And if it wasn’t for him, I would never take chances in life,” the mother of four continues as she chokes up. “And that worked. And also like — we always grew. Because we’ve been together since our early twenties.”</p><p>Erika said Kyle should be proud because their marriage lasted “a really long time”, to which Kyle’s tears began to well. “I know. And it is very admirable and it’s always been something I’m very proud of.”</p><p>“You should still be proud, Kyle,” said Erika, to which Kyle said: “I’m not proud right now,” explaining that her marriage breakdown has been a “letdown” to everyone. “For me, for him, for the kids, for people who don’t even know us. I mean complete strangers are like, ‘We looked up to you guys and you made us believe in true love,’ ” Kyle continued.</p><p>Erika said: “You have to make yourself happy. You’ve raised these girls. You’ve been a good wife to this man. You’ve been a great sister, a great daughter, but if you’re not happy inside – whatever that means for you — you must take that time and find out what you need, and where you need to go with this life,” she advises her longtime friend. Kyle concluded, wiping tears away: “And if we can’t work it out?”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kyle-richards-and-mauricio-umansky-respond-to-cheating-rumors>Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky respond to cheating rumors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky.jpg><p>Kyle and Mauricio responded to cheating rumors in a joint statement on their Instagram accounts on July 4, 2023, in which they also denied they were divorcing. “In regards to the news that came out about us today… Any claims regarding us divorcing are untrue. However, yes, we have had a rough year,” the statement read.</p><p>“The most challenging one of our marriage. But we both love and respect each other tremendously. There has been no wrongdoing on anyone’s part. Although we are in the public eye, we ask to be able to work through our issues privately. While it may be entertaining to speculate, please do not create false stories to fit a further salacious narrative.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kyle and Mauricio’s behavior on social media has some fans worried before their separation came to light. Bravo fan <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>@FaceReality16</a>&nbsp;posted a series of Instagram stories of evidence of alleged cheating. Most of the stories were developments that Mauricio did not repost stories where Kyle tags him even during their daughter’s wedding and his birthday.</p><p>The stories also note the proximity between country singer Morgan Wade and Kyle after they met in 2022 and Kyle pursued her “edgy” phase. The two ended up getting matching heart tattoos that Kyle showed off on a daytime talk show host where she says it’s really special. @FaceReality16t also pointed out the matching rings that the two constantly wear.</p><p>“It kind of seems hard to deny there might be something going on right now,” @jillbadlotto said in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tiktok.com/@jillbadlotto/video/7249111436876844334>TikTok.</a> “For a couple who is so into each other, and she would just overly gush about him on social media, this just seems very odd to me. One RHOBH fan posted on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.reddit.com/r/RHOBH/comments/14n6bjb/can_we_please_talk_about_the_kyle_richards_and/>Reddit,</a> “Ok I just went through those highlights and I’m convinced. I was like 75% on board until I got to the heart tattoos. Sealed the deL.” Another fan commented, “Whether she has another close friend or something more is speculation, but she doesn’t seem as close to Mo. Maybe she is having a mid-life crisis.”</p><p>Back in April 2023, Mauricio addressed the cheating rumors. “We’re not getting divorced,”he said on an episode of the&nbsp;Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tamra Judge’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Two T’s In a Pod</a>. “I mean, it’s so dumb.”</p><p>“That one stupid story that came out there, and then the girls all, you know, decided to talk about it on the&nbsp;Housewives, and so now it’s a storyline,” he explained. “So there’s definitely some stories out there, and Kyle and I address it, and we’ll take it from there. It is what it is.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Kyle addressed the cheating rumors at 31st Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party in March 2023. “The analyzing of everything is so… we were just talking about that in the car,” she said. “I’m seen out at the gym without a ring on, or the rumors about weight loss. I just… I can’t keep up anymore, and I was just telling&nbsp;[Dorit Kemsley]&nbsp;in the car ride over that I don’t even care anymore…&nbsp;All I know is my anxiety is better than it’s ever been and I just… I just can’t stress about it anymore.”</p><p>In August 2023, Kyle and Morgan filmed a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMBdY4D8h-I">music video </a>for the latter’s single, &nbsp;“Fall in Love with Me,” in which the Real Housewives star plays her love interest. “The internet asked and @kylerichards18 and I delivered,” she wrote on Instagram of the clip, adding a winking face.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://people.com/morgan-wade-shuts-down-kyle-richards-relationship-rumors-exclusive-7734905 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, Wade clarified their relationship status. “We’re friends. The Internet’s a dumb place,” Wade told&nbsp;in a recent interview.</p><p>“We thought it would kind of be a good idea to poke fun at that and troll the trolls a little bit… the internet is going to be popping off about this one, I’m sure,” Morgan shared in a behind-the-scenes video. Kyle added: “Well, if they’re gonna talk, we might as well give them something to talk about.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lWppbmpgZLi6uMRmqaKbmJa%2Fpb%2BMnJ%2BemaRiuqLB0aKaoqdf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./first-dates-steph-kyriacou-positive-trans-representation-exclusive.html>&#171;&nbsp;First Dates star Steph Kyriacou praises show for showing 'normal life' of trans people exclusive</a>
