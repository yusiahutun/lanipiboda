He memorizes your schedules and routines</h3><p class=align-left>Taurus men are known to memorize the daily schedules and routines of ladies. This kind of man is not the best when it comes to displaying bold actions in love which is why they prefer to use a more subtle approach. He will seek your attention by showing up unexpectedly in your life.</p><p class=align-left>It may be at the bus stop in the morning, during a lunch break or even in yoga. A Taurus man is shy and will take time to admire you from far before making his move. Take his admiration of you as a compliment as this is one of the obvious signs that a Taurus man likes you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><h3>2. A Taurus man will open up when around you</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the most common signs of a Taurus man being in love with you. He may be shy, but once he has gotten your attention, he will bolster his confidence and make his move. He will show you that you mean the world to him by opening up when he is around you because this is his only chance to get to know you better.</p><p class=align-left>Such a man will talk louder when around his close friends, but it will take some courage for him to make himself known in your presence. Men of this zodiac sign will do everything they can to find a topic of interest to get your attention. He will put effort to know more about you and will give you plenty of compliments regarding your looks as well.</p><h3>3. Tries hard to impress you with well-thought compliments</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/53d302b45e0254d6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 16 funny numbers to call when you are bored or for pranks</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Taurus man does not rush things but thinks carefully before he acts. As a result, he will not try to impress you with empty words but with thoughtful and well-crafted words. He will come across as someone who is most concerned with the impression he makes and will try too hard to pass a simple message.</p><p class=align-left>He is the kind of man that will keep telling you how beautiful you look every time he sees you. His admiration will always be showered through thoughtful compliments. In return, you should know how to handle a Taurus man by allowing him to express himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg><h3>4. A Taurus man will share his luxurious lifestyle with you</h3><p class=align-left>He will want you to know that he has a taste for all the good things life has to offer. Be ready to be pampered with things like fancy dates in which he will not hold back from showing his ability to manage his finances and make you feel special at the same time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/582612be59111409.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ cute contact names for your boyfriend in your phone</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A Taurus man has probably created a life of luxury for himself, and all he wants is someone special to share all that with. His obsession with you will be evident in the way he is eager to share his lifestyle with you. He will buy you expensive jewellery, take you on rides, and take care of all your needs so you can have a comfortable life.</p><h3>5. He displays a certain sensuality and physical affection</h3><p class=align-left>Taurus is an earth sign, and for that reason, men who have this zodiac sign are known for their indulgence in sensual and physical pleasure. He will always find an excuse to show you physical affection, and by so doing, the Taurus man is testing you to see if you love him back.</p><p class=align-left>He may offer to massage your shoulders or even hold your hand. He can’t seem to get enough of such physical pleasure, and the same courtesy will eventually be extended to you. The man will also find the right excuses for the two of you to be alone for him to steal a kiss or even indulge romantically.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ac1d6a28101354e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>150+ headlines for a dating site for females to attract guys online</span></p></a><h3>6. Act like a secret admirer long after you have started your relationship</h3><p class=align-left>To go along with the Taurus man traits of shyness and keeping to self, your man will tend to show how much he likes you by leaving you little gifts. At this stage, he is also not confident that you will like him back, which is why he will tend to play it safe.</p><p class=align-left>He will not leave anything to chance, and because he is a sensitive man, he will put effort even in the smallest gestures. He will want to know how you feel about him before he commits himself to ask you to be the love of his life.</p><h3>7. He will be shy and may act awkward around you</h3><p class=align-left>If a Taurus guy acts shy and awkward around you, know that he likes you a lot. That is the weakness of men who have this zodiac sign and may lose the girl of their dreams because of their fear to express themselves. A Taurus man’s communication style is not the clearest, but his intentions are always genuine.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa51becc7f79a536.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 books that make you think about love in a different way</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you really like him, you have to cut him some slack and even tease him to boost his confidence. He may find it difficult to find the right words to say to you but given a chance; you will find that he is adorable and charming. With time, his jokes will start to make sense, and you will find yourself wanting to listen to him more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg><h3>8. He will be your handy-man</h3><p class=align-left>His handy-man skills will benefit greatly from his rugged and muscular physique. He will capitalize on these skills to impress you by doing extra work even when he doesn’t need to do. He will fix your sink, change a light bulb or repair your chair and you will be impressed at the end of it.</p><p class=align-left>By now, all you know is that he likes to enjoy the finer things in life, so it will come as a surprise to see him sweaty as he does some labour. You no longer have to call a mechanic to fix your car because your Taurus man will fix it without you even noticing that it had a problem in the first place.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6d7ce0f0a4347c04.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ rest in peace quotes for grandpa and grandma</span></p></a><h3>9. Wanting you all to himself at all times</h3><p class=align-left>The personality of Taurus men in relationships drives them to want to spend all of their time with the love of their lives. This kind of man is not the outgoing type, and as a result, you will be the only company such a man wishes to spend his time with. His focus will be on how to develop a lasting relationship that can withstand the test of time with stability.</p><p class=align-left>He will, in return, need a lot of attention from you to boost his confidence in what you are establishing. Even though he is possessive, make sure not to be available all the time so that he can put some effort into chasing you.</p><h3>10. He will take you seriously</h3><p class=align-left>You will know that a Taurus man fancies you when he starts taking you seriously. His strengths are in his pragmatic and practical approach to everything in life. He will give you priority in all matters just to let you know how much he cares about you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/48380575811b48d2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Prayer for missing person to safely return</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He will go the extra mile to show that he listens and values your opinions, interests and goals. If you are speaking in a gathering, expect your Taurus man to hone in on you. He will remember most of the words you say with a genuine interest.
