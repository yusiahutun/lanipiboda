to catch Brianna Kupfer's killer.</p><p>The city is offering $50k for information leading to an arrest, while a further $200k has been donated from the community.</p><p>On Tuesday, LAPD identified a suspect: 31-year-old Shawn Laval Smith, a career criminal with more than a dozen arrests — who was out on $1k bail at the time of the killing.</p><p>He is described as a Black male, 6'3" tall and 190lbs.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e2/4by3/2022/01/19/e2a9cbcdeeff4df8af88c07353d29dcf_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"He should be considered armed and dangerous, if seen do not approach call 911," police warned in a bulletin.</p><p>"Smith has been in Pasadena, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Covina, San Diego, San Francisco and several other locations around southern California," it said. "He is highly likely to be using public transportation. Special attention should be given to bus stops and train platforms."</p><p>Police also released surveillance footage from a nearby 7-Eleven, showing the suspect casually buying a vape pen — and even returning to exchange it for another — 30 minutes after the slaying:</p><p>Another tragic detail emerged at Tuesday's press conference: at 1:36 PM on Friday, while working alone in the store, Brianna texted a friend to tell her there was someone inside who was "giving her a bad vibe."</p><p>"Regrettably, that person did not see the text immediately," Lt. John Radke told reporters.</p><p>Exactly 14 minutes later, a customer walked in to find Brianna laying on the floor lifeless, covered in blood.</p><p>Despite his well-kempt appearance, investigators believe the suspect is homeless because, in part, he travels on foot and wears a backpack, likely filled with spare clothes.</p><p>Lt. Radke confirmed the suspect had entered other stores before the killing, but only Croft House had an employee working alone. "That probably played into this," he said.</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original story 1/17/2022 11:12 AM pst</p><p>A 24-year-old UCLA student is dead after a homeless man randomly walked into the furniture store where she worked and stabbed her, police say.</p><p>Brianna Kupfer was working at high-end store Croft House in Hancock Park on her own on Friday afternoon when she was attacked.</p><p>According to LAPD the suspect — who is still at large — did not know the victim and was a "random walk in to the store."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:cde1ed38-ad94-48a5-ab07-1c6673bba437 data-container-ref=toofab:article:79ff0e61-f72f-4ead-8b2b-eb500fa7fe67 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/39/5by4/2022/01/06/396854b6fc5f4c7386161f4d29a5396e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">GoFundMe/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Texas Dad Gunned Down Carrying Daughter's Birthday Cake into Chuck E.
