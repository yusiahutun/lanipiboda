Keep reading to find out more about the celebrity wife.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Nina Li Chi is the wife of the world-famous Chinese martial artist, actor, and film producer Jet Li. However, many do not know that Nina is not his first but his second wife. Here’s all we know about her and some interesting facts about her relationship with Jet Li.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Nina_Li_Chi></span>Who Is Nina Li Chi?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nina Li Chi is a retired Hong Kong actress best known as the wife of legendary martial artist and actor <a href=#>Jet Li</a>. She came into this world on December 31, 1961, in Shanghai, China, where she spent most of her early days.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nina-li-chi.png><p>Nina is also known by her Chinese name Li Chi or Li Zhi. Her parents’ identities are unknown, but her father was a stage actor who had taught in the actor studios in Shanghai and Canton and can be considered the “<a href=#>Lee Strasberg</a>” of China.</p><p>Her early educational background is also unknown to the public. Still, it has been revealed that she attended the University of San Francisco in the United States of America, where she completed the requirements for a degree in economics and business. She returned to Hong Kong after graduating from the university.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nina_Li_Chis_Career></span>Nina Li Chi’s Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While much younger, she competed in beauty pageants thanks to her stunning looks and near-perfect body. In 1986, Nina competed in the Miss Asia Pacific Hong Kong competition, winning the prize title.&nbsp;</p><p>A few months later, on September 30, 1986, Nina participated in another beauty pageant called the Miss Asia Pacific Quest 1986. She did not win this one but placed third runner-up in the competition.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/yuu.jpg><p>After these beauty pageants, Nina decided to follow her passion for acting. Still, in 1986, she began her acting career in Hong Kong with a role in the film “The Seventh Curse.” It was up from there for the celebrity wife as she continued taking up various parts, making her one of the most distinguished Chinese leasing actresses in the late 80s and 90s.&nbsp;</p><p>She was widely known in the industry for her beautiful sex appeal, which earned her the reputation of “Marilyn of the East.” At first, Nina was not very successful in the movie industry. She wasn’t taken seriously by filmmakers, but with the help and recommendations of legendary stars like Jackie Chan, she was soon recognized as one of the most hardworking actresses in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Barely two years after her acting debut, Nina became the fifth highest-paid actress in Hong Kong. However, her career was a short one that lasted from 1987 to 1992. Within that short period, the actress collaborated with megastars like <a href=#>Jackie Chan</a>, Samuel Hui, Sanmi Kam-Bo Hung, and Chow Yun-Fat.&nbsp;</p><p>She retired in 1992 to become an investor in mainland China, but sadly, her business crashed just four years later in 1996. After the collapse of her investments, she retired to a private life and has led a life majorly out of the media’s attention ever since.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nina_Li_Chis_Movies></span>Nina Li Chi’s Movies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her career may have lasted only five years, but Nina has credited roles in over 20 movies. Some of her <a href=#>credited projects</a> include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Lover’s Tear</li><li>The Seventh Curse</li><li>Amnesty Decree</li><li>Seven Years Itch</li><li>The Beauty Diu Sim</li><li>Tiger on the Beat</li><li>The Greatest Lover</li><li>Pedicab Driver</li><li>Dragon Fight</li><li>Four Loves</li><li>What a Small World.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Jet_Lis_Spouse></span>Who Is Jet Li’s Spouse?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jet Li’s wife is the beautiful Nina Li Chi. The couple first met in 1988 while working together on a movie called “Dragon Fight.” Nina was working as an extra on set while Jet Li was one of the leads in the film. They began dating and got married shortly after their meeting. The couple has been together since then and has two beautiful daughters from their union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/botthh.jpg><p>Their daughters are Jane, born in 1991, and Jada, born in 1996. Jet Li has other children from his previous relationship with Huang Qiuyan and remains an active father to all his children.&nbsp;</p><p>His relationship with his wife has flourished over the years, and they have gone through various hurdles together. Due to the nature of Jet Li’s work, they have been separated for long periods while he was filming, but they have found a way to keep their marriage afloat.&nbsp;</p><p>Nina is still retired but continues to show support for Jet Li and his acting career at all times. She also accompanied him to several events and red carpets on some occasions. Sometimes, the entire family steps out as a unit, while at other times, just some of them can be seen.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ku6q6wGajomWTnbZuucSeq2ailal6rbXSZq6inpVk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-psychology-behind-cheating.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Psychology Behind Cheating</a>
