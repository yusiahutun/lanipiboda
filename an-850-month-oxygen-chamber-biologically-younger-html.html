One unexpected bonus is that I can't hear the chaos of barking dogs and thundering teenagers in my home for a whole hour.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And then there's the startling transformation I've been promised to my face and body.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Welcome to hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's the latest anti-ageing trend, albeit far more cumbersome than an LED light mask or hand-held gadget. Every billionaire worth their salt has invested in a chamber for smoother skin on the outside and younger cells within. I say billionaire because these chambers cost tens of thousands to buy and are so large many owners have special rooms designed to house them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Originally developed to treat divers with the 'bends' as a result of rising to the ocean surface too quickly, HBOT involves breathing up to 95 per cent pure oxygen within a high-pressure chamber.</p><img id=i-6cdcd86c07e09a4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/26/19/70268873-12017085-image-a-2_1682533911296.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="UK writer Alice Smellie investigates the latest anti-ageing trend and its claims.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared it for use in hearing loss and severe skin and bone infection. And it's being used to treat patients with long Covid.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But serious health benefits aside, HBOT is also proving good for our complexions. A recent clinical trial showed collagen fibres (which keep our skin plump) increased in density after use.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In another 2020 study, researchers gave a group of healthy people aged over 64 a total of 60 hyperbaric sessions over 90 days. The results were incredible; their telomeres, which are found at the ends of our chromosomes and are indicative of our biological age, grew up to 38 per cent longer and the ageing of blood cells halted, said researchers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I was obviously eager to give HBOT a go. So I borrowed a £60,000 chamber for six weeks from HybO2 House, an oxygen therapy clinic in Winchester. A chamber normally costs from £850 a month to rent, but even so, the clinic has seen a 100 per cent increase in demand for at-home anti-ageing use over the last year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You don't have to install one in your own home; HBOT sessions are available at clinics and spas nationwide, although they easily cost £100 a go.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Before getting inside, I have detailed pictures of my face taken at the Quinn Clinic in Bristol, using Visia imaging to measure wrinkle depth, redness and pigmentation. I also do a comprehensive BUPA health assessment, including checking my heart and blood pressure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At 50, I have plenty of minor, middle-aged ailments. There's the start of a frozen left shoulder, I creak in the mornings and I don't sleep brilliantly. In addition, my skin is lacklustre and the wrinkles around my eyes are deepening.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So, how does HBOT work? 'The air we normally breathe is 21 per cent oxygen, 79 per cent nitrogen and trace gases,' says Stephen Bridgewater of HybO2 House.</p><img id=i-8917cc5db2a64319 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/26/19/70268867-12017085-image-a-3_1682533928735.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Originally developed to treat divers with the 'bends' as a result of rising to the ocean surface too quickly, HBOT involves breathing up to 95 per cent pure oxygen within a high-pressure chamber" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Originally developed to treat divers with the 'bends' as a result of rising to the ocean surface too quickly, HBOT involves breathing up to 95 per cent pure oxygen within a high-pressure chamber</p><img id=i-6139c95de31e084a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/26/19/70268813-12017085-image-a-4_1682533936594.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="It is clinically proven to help with sports injuries, wound healing and head injuries.

At the same time, the air pressure is increased, creating a hyperbaric environment up to three times atmospheric pressure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This alters our physiology and increases the amount of oxygen our blood can carry. Under these conditions, the lungs also gather more oxygen than would be possible by breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After each session, as you start breathing normal air again, the body feels as though it is being deprived of those lovely high levels of oxygen and reacts by forming new blood pathways where there is injury or inflammation in a process called angiogenesis — this is one of the many factors creating the health and healing benefits.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When my chamber arrives, I am amazed by its vast size but it's surprisingly straightforward to use. There's a control panel where you programme the length of your session, required pressure and how fast you want compression and decompression to happen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As I climb in, I am disconcerted. There's not enough room to sit up, and the mask feels tight. There is an emergency stop in case of disaster.</p><img id=i-c8a3caeb0073d4a2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/26/19/70268845-12017085-image-a-6_1682533946476.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="In another 2020 study, researchers gave a group of healthy people aged over 64 a total of 60 hyperbaric sessions over 90 days.

There's a loud click as the door secures and a hissing sound as the pressure rises. The first time I do this, Stephen is standing reassuringly outside the door — but even so it feels a little claustrophobic. Apart from being very aware of my deep breathing through the mask, I find the experience relaxing. My ears pop when I swallow, but otherwise that's the only difference I notice. For maximum benefits the chamber is used for an hour, five days a week, with two days off.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By the end of week one, the mobility in my frozen shoulder has, miraculously, returned to normal. After three weeks, my twice-weekly swim is noticeably faster and I feel that my lung capacity has improved. I also knock a good five minutes off my usual 5km meander around local country lanes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Thanks to a tight work deadline, I am highly stressed, but amazingly, I find myself sleeping well and full of energy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But what about my skin? After a couple of weeks it certainly looks brighter and clearer. Incidentally, I don't change anything else in my lifestyle. Change is gradual, so I don't notice wrinkles melting away, but friends start to comment on how fresh I look and even ask what I've 'had done'.</p><img id=i-f1b2c0eba3149193 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/26/19/70268807-12017085-image-a-8_1682533958204.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="There's a control panel where you programme the length of your session, required pressure and how fast you want compression and decompression to happen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>There's a control panel where you programme the length of your session, required pressure and how fast you want compression and decompression to happen</p><img id=i-8b68c130d1c16a69 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/26/19/70268811-12017085-image-a-9_1682533962207.jpg height=465 width=634 alt="A chamber normally costs from £850 a month to rent, but even so, the clinic has seen a 100 per cent increase in demand for at-home anti-ageing use over the last year" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>A chamber normally costs from £850 a month to rent, but even so, the clinic has seen a 100 per cent increase in demand for at-home anti-ageing use over the last year</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When I return for a second BUPA health check just under eight weeks later, I discover that my ten-year risk of my having a cardiovascular event (such as a stroke) has gone down very slightly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>My cholesterol has also improved (for those in the know, my cholesterol/HDL ratio has gone from 3.2 to 2.8). My risk score for diabetes is down from 0.5 to 0.1.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But it's the second Visia scan that's mind-blowing. Aesthetic expert Dr John Quinn reveals my wrinkles have gone from the 56th centile (which is to say out of 100 women the same age as me, 46 have fewer wrinkles) to the 95th centile, so now only five out of 100 have fewer wrinkles. This confirms what I can see in the mirror.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The biggest difference is in the quality of your skin, especially under the eyes,' says Dr Quinn. 'Pores are less obvious, there's less puffiness, dark circles are reduced and your face has less redness.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The most surprising improvement is possibly the most middle-aged. Having recently joined a local choir, I'd been struggling to reach the top notes. To my joy, my youthful range has returned, and I can reach a top A without sounding like a dying mouse.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Most healing aspects, such as soft tissue injuries, are permanent, and I'd need to have regular sessions to maintain a youthful glow. Nonetheless, I'm grateful for the billionaire boost.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>FROM £850 a month to rent a chamber and £100 per salon session (block of ten), hybo2.com.
