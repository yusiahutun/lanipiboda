Today, we're zeroing in on Scottie Pippen, the versatile wingman who was always more than just Jordan's sidekick. Few players were as consistent as Pippen, but there were three seasons when his game ascended to a higher plane, and those are the ones we'll focus on today.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ranked third is the 1991-92 season. The Bulls were in the midst of their first three-peat, and Pippen was starting to make noise. His statistical line read like a guard's dream: 21.0 PPG, 7.7 RPG, and 7.0 APG, with a sprinkle of 1.9 SPG and 1.1 BPG for good measure. His efficiency was commendable, shooting over 50% from the field. Pippen demonstrated a knack for seeing the floor and creating for others, which was reflected in his then career-high 7.0 assists per game.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>But the stats don't tell the whole story. Pippen was the Bulls' Swiss Army knife, capable of doing a little bit of everything. His performance this season was a testament to his versatility, seamlessly shifting between roles as needed. It was a season that saw Pippen grow into his role as a facilitator while maintaining his defensive intensity and contributing significantly to the scoring column.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Number two on our list is the 1994-95 season. This was another post-Jordan year, and Pippen was now the cornerstone of the Bulls. His stat line was as filled as ever: 21.4 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 5.2 APG, 2.9 SPG, and 1.1 BPG. Moreover, his 3-point shooting improved this season, with Pippen shooting at a respectable 34.5% from beyond the arc.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>This season was a testament to Pippen's evolution. He improved as a scorer, but more importantly, Pippen displayed a newfound confidence in his long-range shooting. The uptick in 3-point shooting percentage wasn't just a statistical anomaly; it was a result of Pippen stepping into the void left by Jordan and expanding his game. He was still setting up his teammates, but Pippen was also more willing to take the big shots himself.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-108 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>And at the top of our list is the 1993-94 season. This was Pippen's apex, the season he stepped out of Jordan's shadow and showed the world he could be the main man on a championship contender. Pippen put up a career-best 22.0 PPG, complemented by 8.7 RPG, 5.6 APG, 2.9 SPG, and 0.8 BPG.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>This season was Pippen unleashed. His usage rate was at an all-time high, and he responded by leading the Bulls in scoring. But it wasn't just his scoring that impressed; Pippen's defensive stats were equally exceptional. His 2.9 SPG led the league, a testament to his prowess on that end of the floor.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>But beyond the numbers, this was a season of leadership for Pippen. Without Jordan, he was the undisputed leader of the Bulls, a role he embraced fully. Pippen's game was not just about scoring; he was also the team's primary playmaker, leading fast breaks and setting up his teammates. He was the first line of defense, frequently guarding the opposing team's best player. This was Pippen at his absolute best, a force on both ends of the court, a true two-way player before it became a buzzword.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>However, what truly set this season apart was not just the numbers, but the narrative surrounding it. Here was Pippen, the perennial sidekick, thrust into a starring role. And boy, did he shine. He carried a Bulls team, sans Jordan, to a 55-win season and a deep playoff run. This was the season that Pippen proved he could be the alpha of a team, and not just a superlative second option.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Pippen's 1993-94 season was about more than just stats; it was about resilience and stepping up. Pippen was no longer just a versatile forward; he was now a bona fide superstar. This was the season that cemented Pippen's status as one of the all-time greats, the year he stepped out from the shadow of Air Jordan and into the spotlight.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyvrsBoqpynpKm2pnnPoqepnZ6oenR5wZ6qrWWjmq60u82s</p></div><div id=links><a href=./should-you-be-using-castor-oil-on-natural-hair-6828754.html>&#171;&nbsp;Should You Be Using Castor Oil on Natural Hair?</a>
