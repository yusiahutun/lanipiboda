The season 20 Bachelorette is Charity Lawson, a contestant from The Bachelor season 27 with Zach Shallcross, who came in fourth place after she was eliminated by Zach after their Hometown Date. Charity is the fourth Black Bachelorette in Bachelor Nation history after Rachel Lindsay (season 13); Tayshia Adams (season 16) and Michelle Young (season 18).&nbsp;</p><p>Charity was announced as the next Bachelorette for 2023 at The Bachelor season 27 “Women Tell All” special on March 15, 2023. “Stop! Is this for real? “No way! Oh my god, I’m gonna cry.” Charity asked host Jesse Palmer when he offered her the opportunity to be the season 20 Bachelorette. Palmer responded, “Is that a yes? Will you do it?” to which Charity replied, “Absolutely! 100 percent!” She continued, “I’ve waited forever to find the love of my life. It blows my mind that I could meet my person and be engaged and literally have my happily ever after.”</p><p>Before Charity was announced as the next Bachelorette for 2023, Zach confirmed his support for Charity as the new lead in an interview with Us Weekly in March 2023. “She knows what she wants. She is so confident, she’s so sweet and, you know, she has a great heart,” Zach said. “She’s someone from the very beginning that—I don’t know what exactly it was—but [she] was just trustworthy. She was someone that I asked to, like, get her take on things and while there was some drama in the house early, she was always someone that I believed in [and] I trusted it too. She’s a very trustworthy person and I think she would absolutely kill it as Bachelorette.”</p><p>Palmer also supported Charity as the next Bachelorette. “I think she’d be awesome,” he said, adding that he “totally gets” why so many fans wanted Charity to be the new lead. He continued, “It’s hard because I feel like in past seasons we’ve had an obvious choice, like, two, maybe three [choices]. I feel like this season, there’s five or six that could be tremendous. So I’d love to know who it is and whoever it is, I’m sure it’s going to be an amazing season.”</p><p>Aly Jacobs, who came in eighth place The Bachelor season 27, also voted Charity as the next Bachelorette. “I would definitely say Charity. That’s my girl. I think everyone got to see a little taste of how protective some of us are over Charity when we were in Estonia,” Aly told Us Weekly, referring to when Kat Izzo snuck time with Zach before charity’s one-on-one date. “She’s a gem. She’s so cool, calm and collected. She’s very level-headed and I think, she would have just the best love story, something that I would want to tune into. So, definitely Charity.”</p><p>Brooklyn Willie, who came in sixth place on The Bachelor season 27, also voiced her support for Charity as the next Bachelorette. “If it can’t be me, then I want it to be Charity,” she said. “Charity has been my best friend through the whole thing. I think she is incredible. She’s very intelligent, she’s beautiful. She knows what she wants. This previous season, she’s just had so many moments taken from her. I want to see her get her moment to the full capacity, the full extent, and just absorb every last minute.”</p><p>Cat Wong, who was eliminated in week two on The Bachelor season 27, told Us Weekly, “I would a hundred percent nominate Charity. I think Charity would just be the best thing for this franchise that they need. She’s so in tune with her emotions and she carries her so well in group settings and individually, but also was, like, fun and light-hearted and just is the whole package. And I think that that’s something very refreshing to see — that a beautiful woman can also have all these amazing intellectual qualities too.”</p><p>Kylee Russell, who was eliminated in week five on The Bachelor season 27, also confirmed she was Team Charity as the next Bachelorette. “I am Team Charity. And she was my girl from night one,” Kylee told Us Weekly. “I think she’s so deserving. She deserves everything and more this world has to offer. … She’s a little feisty. She is not afraid to go after what she wants. So she has this calm, sweet demeanor and don’t get me wrong, she’s not a mean girl or anything, but she will stand up for what she believes in.”</p><p>So who is the Bachelorette for 2023, Charity Lawson?
