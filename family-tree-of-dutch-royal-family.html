During the invasion of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany in 1939, Juliana was evacuated to the United Kingdom before heading to Canada. She returned to her country of birth on 2 May 1945.</p><p id=e6vnsDXqycc data-wc=38>Juliana met her husband, Prince Bernhard, at the 1936 Winter Olympics, and the couple married less than a year later on 7 January 1937.

The former queen remained active in charitable activities, but started withdrawing from public life in the 1990s.

In 1937, he married the then-Princess Juliana and became the Prince Consort upon her accession to the throne on 4 September 1948.</p><p id=eiBQ4zzyMqp data-wc=58>Bernhard was f<strong>ound to have been a member of the Nazi Party during his life, however, in World War II he supported the Allies and saw active service as an honorary wing commander in the RAF</strong>. As an honorary general in the Dutch army, he was involved in negotiations for Germany's withdrawal from the Netherlands following the war.</p><p id=eoi2L1OXVXf data-wc=47>Bernhard was known for his interest in charitable causes and was a founding member of the WWF, however, his business dealings attracted controversy and he was forced to withdraw from the organisation and the Bilderberg Group due to his involvement in a bribery scandal around Lockheed aircraft.</p><p id=eOHveRb-cQ2 data-wc=28>Alongside his children with Juliana, <strong>Bernhard also fathered Alicia von Bielefeld and Alexia Grinda through extramarital affairs</strong>; their status as his daughters wasn't revealed until after his death.</p><p id=eFnkQedVLhD data-wc=78>The royal started encountering health woes in 1994 when he required a tumour to be removed from his colon and he suffered from complications from respiratory distress. His prognosis was so bad, his daughter Queen Beatrix rushed to hospital following a trip to Africa, however, he would go on to recover. Following his wife's death on 20 March 2004, <strong>Bernhard's health worsened significantly and he died at the age of 93 on 1 December 2004 of lung cancer</strong>.</p><h2>Queen Beatrix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/41bb3c81ae41-queen-beatrix-hague-university.jpg><p id=e1j3EMCr-3dR data-wc=51>Born on 31 January 1938, <strong>Queen Beatrix ascended to the throne on 30 April 1980</strong>, following the decision of her mother, Queen Juliana, to abdicate. Like the rest of her family, Beatrix was evacuated from the Netherlands during World War II, returning to the country once the war had been won.</p><p id=enH_6tSotNrN data-wc=49>In 1965,<strong>&nbsp;Beatrix's engagement to Claus von Amsberg caused controversy due to his earlier involvement with the Hitler Youth and the Wehrmacht</strong>. The couple married on 10 March 1966 and welcomed three sons, King Willem-Alexander, Prince Friso and Prince Constantijn. Friso sadly died in 2013 following a ski accident.</p><p id=eCBDnKykuGTK data-wc=21>Beatrix and Claus remained married until the Prince Consort's death on 6 October 2002, following complications of pneumonia and Parkinson's disease.</p><p id=eTfu_jxuysTn data-wc=61>On 30 April 2009, <strong>Beatrix and other senior members of the royal family were targeted in an attack during the Koninginnedag (Queen's Day) celebrations</strong>. The attacker, Karst Tates, ran people down with a car, before crashing into a memorial, although he had been aiming for a bus carrying the royals. Although no royals were harmed, they did witness the crash itself.</p><p id=eplYnbBorcSJ data-wc=41>Four years later, to the day, Beatrix abdicated the throne in favour of her son, Willem-Alexander. The royal had made clear her plans to abdicate in an address on 28 January 2013.

The couple courted in private with Irene<strong>&nbsp;keeping her religious conversion secret and their engagement caused a constitutional crisis due to possible associations with Spanish dictator Francisco Franco</strong>. The crisis became so much that <strong>Juliana even attempted to stop the marriage</strong>; the only reason the monarch didn't bring her daughter home from Spain was because the Dutch government threatened to resign en masse.</p><p id=e6_qH6X9Wd_C data-wc=55>Irene and Carlos Hugo married on 29 April 1964 with no members of the Dutch royal family present. The pair welcomed four children, Prince Carlos, the Duke of Parma (b. 1970), Princess Margarita de Bourbon de Parme (b. 1972), Jaime de Bourbon de Parme (b. 1972) and Princess Carolina de Bourbon de Parme (b. 1974).</p><p id=eKQ895V-7EP_ data-wc=68>Following the restoration of the monarchy in Spain, Irene and her husband were exiled from the country for being opponents of the new King, Juan Carlos; these were later rescinded.

Due to World War II, Margriet wouldn't enter the Netherlands until she was two.</p><p id=e5HZM6GRrrsQ data-wc=45>While studying at Leiden University, Margriet met law student Pieter van Vollenhoven and the pair wed on 10 January 1967.

The couple welcomed three children: Bernardo (b. 1977), Nicolas (b. 1979) and Juliana (b. 1981), but the pair ultimately divorced on 25 April 1996.</p><p id=e-LR0NTCoHwc data-wc=55>A talented singer, Christina became a teacher in New York City and would perform at family occasions, including the funerals of her parents and the wedding of her nephew, Prince Bernhard Jr. However, in June 2018, <strong>the royal was diagnosed with bone cancer and she died at the age of 72 on 16 August 2019</strong>.</p><h2>King Willem-Alexander</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/61e5391f1784-king-willem-alexander-veterans-day.jpg><p id=ezU5Y-zhLOAs data-wc=54>Born on 27 April 1967, <a class=hm-link href=#>Willem-Alexander</a> is the current monarch of the Netherlands and head of the House of Orange-Nassau after ascending to the throne following Beatrix's abdication on 30 April 2013.

The royal's condition was believed to have evolved to being in a minimally conscious state <strong>and he died on 12 August 2013 at the age of 44</strong>.
