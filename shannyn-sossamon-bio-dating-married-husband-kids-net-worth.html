After graduating high school in the mid-1990s and relocating to Los Angeles she developed a strong passion for dancing.

She then went on to feature in music videos of renowned artists like Daft Punk and Cher furthering her career in the industry.</p><p>After appearing in various television shows such as the 1997 comedy series Mr. Show with Bob and David (her acting debut) she took a giant step forward with her portrayal of Lady Jocelyn in her first film “A Knight’s Tale” (2001). It is reported that she surpassed the renowned actress Kate Hudson in auditions for the female lead role in the film.

In 2002 Shannyn was involved in a romantic affair with Dallas Clayton, a writer, and illustrator, and by 2004 the couple had already split up again. But what seemed like a short affair produced a child – yes! The couple had a son together.</p><p>Audio Science Clayton was born on 29 May, 2003, and although Shannyn claimed at the time that she was not yet ready for the experience of motherhood, she succumbed to the situation and enjoyed every moment. She disappeared from the spotlight just to focus all her attention on taking care of her pregnancy and embracing motherhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Shannyn-Sossamon-Award.jpg><p>Later in 2011, Shannyn Sossamon had another boy, Mortimer. Since then she has kept the information about the child’s father secret, like cards that are so close to her breast. But out of the blue, in 2015, she told Details magazine in an interview that she was “on the run” with the father of her second son.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>A Look Into Chip And Joanna Gaines’ Personal Life, Net Worth, Divorce Rumours and Scandals</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Husband</strong></h2><p>It is not known that Shannyn Sossamon is officially married. Her alleged relationship with her boyfriend Dallas Clayton, although very public and also one of the hottest topics in town at the time, did not lead her to the altar (or to the courts, as it may be). She only spoke of a “serious relationship” with her second son, Mortimer’s father, and not of marriage. As such she had never been married before, so the question of a husband or divorce is completely ignored.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kids</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Shannyn Sossamon</a> has two sons – Audio Science Clayton and Mortimer. She first became a mother in 2003 when she gave birth to her first son, Audio Science, with her then-lover and partner Dallas Clayton. She gave birth to him on 29 May 2003.</p><p>After she separated from Clayton in 2004, Shannyn remained single for several years. But then, in 2011, she became pregnant with an unknown partner for the second time. Her second boy, Mortimer, was the result of the pregnancy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Shannyn Sossamon Body Statistics</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Shannyn-Sossamon-Relationship.jpg><p>Shannyn Sossamon has a perfect body with perfect dimensions.
