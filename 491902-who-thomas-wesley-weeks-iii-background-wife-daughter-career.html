The couple tied the knot in a civil ceremony in Las Vegas on July 22, 2002.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d29c3c04f7f76531.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jonathan Nelson's biography: wife, nationality, parents, and siblings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After word of their marriage got out, Weeks and Bynum announced their relationship on Trinity Broadcasting Network (T.B.N.).
