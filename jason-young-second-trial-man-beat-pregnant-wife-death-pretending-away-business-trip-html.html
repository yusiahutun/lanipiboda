His plan was to murder his wife, and his plan was to get away with it,' Holt told jurors in the first trial.<br></span></p><p><span>In his original trial Young made the unusual move of testifying in his own defence. Speaking though tears, he said that, although he was not a exemplary husband, he loved his wife and had no hand in her death.<br></span></p><p><span>This time the prosecution’s opening statement portrayed Young as an juvenile man who didn't want another baby around, ABC News reported.</span></p><p><span>'He was the free spirit. The adventure lover. The irresponsible. The immature. The life of the party. The jokester. The salesman,' </span><span>Holt said, </span><span>according to CNN.<br></span></p><p><span>But the defence’s opening statement argued that the state’s case is mainly circumstantial, and without direct evidence linking Young to the crime scene.<br></span></p><p><span>Attorney Mike Klinkosum conceded that the Youngs were having problems in their marriage, but argued that did not make Jason Young a killer.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p><span>Klinkosum said. </span><span>'I am not here to tell you that he was a good husband. He was far from it,'</span></p><p><span>'He's acted like an obnoxious, juvenile jerk. But what you've got to remember ladies and gentlemen, is that we don't convict people of murder, just because they act like jerks.'</span></p><p><span>Meredith Fisher discovered her sister's lifeless body after getting a voice mail from Jason Young asking her to go to the house to look for some papers about an anniversary present for Michelle.</span></p><p><span>She yesterday remembered the heartbreaking moment of finding her </span><span>dead </span><span>sister, with her small child nearby. She told the court: 'That's the small of her back, that I touched her and felt that she was cold.'</span></p><p><span>When Fisher arrived at the Young house 'the dog was freaking out,' she said in the 911 call played back in court yesterday. Lights were on in the porch and the gate was open. When she got upstairs there was blood everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Holt described the horrific scene that greeted Meredith: '</span><span>She found little footprints in blood. She found them around Michelle’s head. She saw them as she was coming up the stairs in Cassidy’s bathroom. She found baby dolls. A baby doll by Michelle’s head.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/08/article-2098316-11A41964000005DC-241_634x469.jpg height=469 width=634 alt="Wedding day: During the retrial witnesses told the court in North Carolina that Jason and Michelle Young did not have a happy marriage" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Wedding day: During the retrial witnesses told the court in North Carolina that Jason and Michelle Young did not have a happy marriage</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/08/article-2098316-11A419A2000005DC-968_634x471.jpg height=471 width=634 alt="Crime scene: Meredith Fisher found her sister dead after receiving a voice mail from Jason Young asking her to go to the house to look for something" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Crime scene: Meredith Fisher found her sister dead after receiving a voice mail from Jason Young asking her to go to the house to look for some papers</p><p><span>'And she heard Cassidy say, ‘Mommy’s got boo boos</span><span>.'</span></p><p><span>Jason Young showed no visible signs of emotion as the court heard Fisher's emergency call, ABC reported.<br></span></p><p><span>The prosecution are seeking to portray Young as </span><span>a wild party boy, who cheated on his wife and is therefore untrustworthy.</span></p><p><span>Shelly Schaad, a former sorority sister of Michelle Young and the last person to see Michelle alive, took the stand painting an unflattering picture of the software salesman.<br></span></p><p><span>The couple's marriage was troubled and they fought openly, Schaad told the court.</span></p><p><span>'A lot of times they were silly, over things that didn’t really matter. They were constantly trying to one-up the other. And other times it was about the lack of sex in the relationship. Jason was not shy about telling us his opinion on that,' NBC reported.</span></p><p><span>Jason Young was very flirtatious with other women. Michelle had questioned him when they returned from holiday in Puerto Rico with another woman's panties in their luggage, she told the court.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He once urinated in his pants for a dare, the court heard.<br></span></p><p><span>Schaad said: 'One night at my house after a tailgate he urinated on the floor in my house on the rug.</span></p><p><span>'My husband threw him in the shower and he ran out completely naked and sat down on the sofa in front of a group of people. Like it was no big deal,' she said.</span></p><p><span>'At the time we were shocked. We went along with it.'<br></span></p><p><span>Other times he exposed his genitals to men and women at parties, she told the court. On one occasion at the Youngs house he swallowed a woman's wedding ring, the court heard.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/08/article-2098316-11A4197C000005DC-542_634x472.jpg height=472 width=634 alt="Accused: Jason Young was released from jail in July 2011 after posting a $900,000 bond but now could face life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Accused: Jason Young was released from jail in July 2011 after posting a $900,000 bond but now could face life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted</p><p><span>Following Schaad's testimony Elmer Goad</span><span>, the maintenance man from the Hampton Inn in Hillsville, where Young said he was staying, gave evidence about the night of the murder, NBC reported.<br></span></p><p><span>The hotel worker said he noticed a camera was unplugged </span><span>at an emergency exit</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>He and Keith Hicks, the night clerk, got a ladder and reconnected it, the court heard.
