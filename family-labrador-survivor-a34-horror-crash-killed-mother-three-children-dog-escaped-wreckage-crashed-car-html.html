I cannot presume to imagine your anguish but I remember only too well the sickening horror, the disbelief, the impossibility of understanding the magnitude of that horror, when the police came to tell me that our daughter (Grace, 17) had died in a car accident. I thought I would go mad but, because my husband's reaction was frighteningly extreme, suddenly I had to switch from desperately thinking of Grace, and all that was tumbling through my head, to looking after him - when all I wanted to do was think about Grace. She had left on Monday night, saying she would be back by 1pm on Tuesday. Those were her last words to me.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Somehow people imagine you will 'get over it'. There is no such thing for me - and probably that's true for most others who experience a tragedy. We have to learn to get through it; we feel we can never be happy again. The minute I might feel a little happiness, Grace comes into my mind and so I am sad again. I should have been overjoyed at the birth of our first grandson but I took refuge privately in the loo to cry my heart out realising Grace had been my last baby and that she wasn't here to be the most wonderful aunt she would have been.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>We have to learn to live with a tragedy like this. I think of Grace many times every day. It still knocks me back. I was lucky that a complete stranger (now a dear friend) was moved enough to offer to make a website for Grace. It has helped me and those who love Grace, also some who never knew her, to share our feelings, sadness, memories, love.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>At the time, I knew I was lucky.....I was overwhelmingly thankful that we still have our wonderful three sons. Our loss was almost beyond endurance and yours is multiplied beyond my imagination. But, I do want to say that it is extraordinary that one somehow does find the means to endure and meet such terrible loss - and go on. Myself, I remember the numbness of disbelief, the business of coping with all there is to do, the exhaustion of not sleeping and longing for the night to be day, but hardly bearing the day, the extreme dry mouth I got (apparently from shock).....you may feel all of these too. Looking ahead seems impossible, they say the grieving process takes eighteen months....that seemed an unbearable eternity to me and there is no way anyone can put a time limit on it in my view.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>We talk of Grace all the time, we do lots that includes her...we go punting every year on her birthday as we always did....lots of things just keep her with us.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Please have a look at Grace's website one day if you think, in any way, it might help you and all those affected so deeply by your dreadful loss.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Thinking of you so much.
