festival, ran into an improbable number of hurdles in its fifth anniversary outing over the weekend in Miami. Marred by false threats of an active shooter, very real offsite shootings involving Young Thug and NBA YoungBoy, <a href=#>Kodak Black’s wild last-minute arrest</a>, Lil Wayne’s no-show, and unpredictable weather, just about everything that could go wrong did. And yet the show went on as best it could with solid headlining sets from Migos, Travis Scott, and Kid Cudi; star-making performances from <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion</a> and <a href=#>Lil Uzi Vert</a>; and, oh my God, a Billy Ray Cyrus sighting. Vulture was on the ground for everything you might’ve missed.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjvmfrozt001f2a6fw27x0lsv@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>LOW: The gun scares</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvmfvge7001n2a6fnmdjhjzn@published data-word-count=195>We wouldn’t normally begin with a low, but at this year’s Rolling Loud, unfortunately, two frightening false alarms cast a shadow over the festival for much of the weekend. Just as day one, on Friday night, was getting to one of its biggest names, Cardi B, a <a href=#>stampede</a> broke out near the main stage with people running in terror toward the exits amid what turned out to be a false report that an active shooting was taking place. Fans jumped fences and trampled over others to get to safety, and several attendees sustained minor injuries, while security provided no information. Confusingly, the first statement from the festival was a guy over the loudspeaker yelling, “Why is everyone panicking?” Quickly, the music stopped (Rick Ross’s set on a smaller stage was paused) and police, with several choppers overhead, arrived on the scene, after which the festival <a href=#>confirmed</a> there was no cause for concern; performances resumed, with some delays, and those who had exited were permitted to return. The following morning, festival co-founder Tariq Cherif offered slight clarity with a statement that a “disturbance” led to the stampede. “Let’s all come together today with positivity,” he added.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rolling Loud (@rollingloud)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvmgivay00212a6fk0z46dwq@published data-word-count=93>And yet a similar incident happened on Saturday night. During Travis Scott’s headlining set, a swarm of fans stampeded toward stage right following a second gun scare. However, the rush this time lasted only a few minutes before those running realized it was yet another false alarm. The festival did not make a statement addressing the incident, and after a brief lull in Scott’s set (seemingly owing to technical difficulties and Scott’s moving to a higher platform), the festival resumed. No threats were reported on the third and final day of the festival.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjvmi5ico002u2a6fzvw8azbw@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>HIGH: Lil Nas X brought Billy Ray Cyrus and yeehaw culture to a rap festival</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvmi6r8800322a6fgflc2wwv@published data-word-count=58>If you’re only given ten minutes, make it count.

In fact, Kodak never even made it to the festival; instead, he was picked up by police as part of a joint sting by federal agents and local authorities and booked on federal and state firearms charges. It’s not clear what specific incident led to his arrest, but it was <a href=#>reportedly</a> the result of an “extensive investigation.” (And just the latest in <a href=#>his ongoing legal saga</a>.) Despite reports that he’d been arrested on festival grounds, Rolling Loud issued a statement saying that he was “arrested on his way to the festival and we have no knowledge of what led to the arrest since he was not on festival property.” That statement came just hours after Lil Wayne bailed on his Saturday set after insinuating that the Hard Rock Stadium was in cahoots with police. Wayne explained in a tweet that he couldn’t perform after being notified of a mandatory police search to enter the stadium. “I do not and will not ever settle for being policed to do my job,” he wrote. He was ultimately replaced by Meek Mill (who, despite <a href=#>all his very public legal battles</a>, presumably complied with the search).</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>To all my fans who came to see me at Rolling Loud, I’m sorry but I won’t be performing.

Because while, yes, Uzi did tease the album (he completed the last song the other night, he swears), what he did after the tease was the real gift. “Y’all ready for the album?” he asked twice.

Meanwhile, fans both inside and outside the stadium got drenched. Things got muddy afterward, of course, but <a href=#>we’ve seen worse</a>.

After performing the song herself earlier in the day on Friday, Yung Miami turned heads when she joined Yachty for his set for a repeat performance of “Act Up” with him.

While it’s typically where you’ll find all the fresh talent with a tiny (but dedicated!) following, sometimes you’ll also randomly get a rare chance to see huge names in an intimate setting thanks to some scheduling magic.

Travis Scott’s mic cut out entirely during his headlining set on Saturday, interrupting his show; Young Thug couldn’t hear himself for most of his (among general unpreparedness — looking at you, DJ); and someone seemed to forget to turn on the subwoofers during Kid Cudi’s headlining set, sucking a lot of the feeling out of his most emotional songs.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjvmkqxwf00482a6f8qpos3c1@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>WHOA: Young Thug and NBA YoungBoy involved in shootings offsite</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvmks1qu004g2a6f5ark70o0@published data-word-count=89>In addition to Kodak Black, a couple more rappers ran into some dicey situations outside the festival.

I do songs like this, and I think about where I was at, and I look at where I’m at now, in front of y’all, and it’s a beautiful thing to be able to enjoy these songs.” Yes, I cried.
