Brie wasn’t entirely supportive of giving through the signature, which is the case. Masterson was later known to attack three people coming forward to make the investigation work well.</p><p>Things went out of hand when Brie was named as the evidence in the police report regarding the Masterson rape case. Further investigation suggested that one of the rape victims told Brie about it in the first place. This questioned the integrity of Brie itself, and she was willing to get the case closed pretty discreetly.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brie_Shaffer_Net_Worth></span><strong><u>Brie Shaffer Net Worth</u></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Various online reports estimate Brie Shaffer’s net worth around <strong>$200k</strong>.
