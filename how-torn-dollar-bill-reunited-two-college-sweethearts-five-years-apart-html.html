Kaplan shared her stranger-than-fiction love-story to the Modern Love section of the <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>New York Times</a> on Friday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her story begins, aged 18, when she was just a freshman at Cornell University in 1984. Kaplan had been dating 21-year-old Howard since the beginning of term.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Though they fell hard and fast in love, their tender ages - and the fact they lived on opposite coasts of the country, with Kaplan native to New Jersey and Howard residing in San Francisco – the pair decided to re-evaluate their courtship, concluding that neither of them were yet ready for life-long love.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I think finding The One is a matter of person, place and time. What if we’re both the right person but this is the wrong place and time? We’d miss our chance and regret it,’ Kaplan recalls telling Howard in her dorm at the time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She added that she didn’t want to marry the first guy she felt serous about, but she wanted to give her and Howard a second chance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Let’s meet in five years. I’ll be 23, and you’ll be 26. We’ll see if we want to get back together.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Howard agreed, and the pair arranged to meet at the New York Public Library, near the uptown lion, at 4pm on the first Sunday of May, exactly five years later.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kaplan and Howard wrote their pledge on a dollar bill, ripped it in half and each kept a piece of the severed note.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The location was chosen as a public setting would prevent any unwanted intimacy if either – or both- of the pair felt awkward. It also held sentimental value as both Kaplan and Howard were English majors, spending the near entirety of their time at Cornell surrounded by books.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The designated time meant they could begin with a drink, and, if all went well, proceed to go to dinner and see where the night took them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite agreeing to go their separate ways, the couple failed to break-up right away. They continued dating for the rest of the summer and into the next school year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their relation finally ended a semester later when Howard moved away to take up an internship in Manhattan. In the meantime, Kaplan began dating somebody else.</p><img id=i-872f87b35f27df91 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/24/07/17637184-7389853-image-a-3_1566627048184.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Her story begins aged 18, when she was just a freshman at Cornell University (above).

For none of the men were Howard, Kaplan would later realize.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the five year mark approached, Kaplan had moved to Minneapolis and was embroiled in what she remarked to be a dead-end relationship going nowhere fast.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Having not spoken to Howard since they last parted, and living in the age predating social media or cell phones, she knew little of his whereabouts, somewhere in California, but knew nothing of his personal life.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You’re trying to live your life like a movie. Real life doesn’t work like that,’ Kaplan recalls her sister telling her, when she revealed to her the real reason she’d flown from Minneapolis to New Jersey on the first month of May. ‘He’s not even going to remember, much less travel 3,000 miles. You’re setting yourself up for big disappointment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Kaplan disagreed. Despite nearly 60 months passing, she was confident Howard would show and remained optimistic that he wouldn’t settled down with another woman.</p><img id=i-8c4b10b81f0e724d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/24/07/17637182-7389853-_Let_s_meet_in_five_years_I_ll_be_23_and_you_ll_be_26_We_ll_see_-m-5_1566627155838.jpg height=521 width=634 alt="‘Let’s meet in five years.
