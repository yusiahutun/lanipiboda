As soon as you go wireless, you need to contend with weight, comfort, battery life, sound quality, Bluetooth connection quality, and noise cancellation. As such, it's hard to recommend Bluetooth headphones that do a bad job with any of these features.</p><p>All of the picks in this guide offer strong audio quality with careful attention to an even sound signature for gaming on a Nintendo Switch. If the headphones veer too far into niche territory for audiophile listeners, it's difficult to recommend them for gaming.</p><p>Most people need headphones that can handle a variety of games and media with a range of audio effects, which is why we chose products that can do it all, as opposed to products that cater to only certain types of soundscapes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, these headphones also need enough battery life to last you through long gaming sessions. The Switch can last up to a solid day of gaming; your headphones should too. Nobody wants to be in the middle of a game and have to find the charger or stop playing altogether.</p><p>Adding to that, ANC, or <a href=#>active noise cancellation</a>, has to be on point. ANC blocks out noises like plane engines and crowd commotion. This is done by counteracting the sound from outside sources.</p><p>There's more nuance to it, but know that active noise cancellation is essentially a special computer chip in your headphones that is beneficial to your listening experience. A lot of people take their Switch out in public or play it during a commute. ANC technology has to be good enough to keep that experience distraction-free without affecting headphone battery life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bluetooth headphones also have to be comfortable and lightweight. There's no reason to feel like your headphones are weighing you down or squeezing your head. For most people, all of the picks in our guide should feel sturdy and comfortable on your head.</p><p>It's a lot to keep in mind, but don't worry---our Switch Bluetooth headphone recommendations have you covered.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>17</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>8</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>24</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It's fine for casual games, but if you're looking for headphones that will give you an advantage in multiplayer games, other wireless connectivity options can be handy. That's precisely where the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Logitech G735 Wireless Gaming Headset</a> excels.</p><p>The G735 supports Bluetooth, just like all the other headphones we're looking at here. That said, the secret weapon is Logitech's Lightspeed wireless. Similar to the <a href=#>Logitech G Fits Gaming Earbuds</a>, the G735 includes a dongle that fits into the Switch's USB-C port, giving you wireless audio with far lower latency than Bluetooth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The G735 headset is built with long sessions in mind. Logitech's website mentions that the G735 are built for all sorts of people, including those with smaller heads or who wear glasses. No matter what, they should be comfortable all day.</p><p>If you like a splash of color in your gaming headset, you'll find plenty to like here. Logitech's Lightsync RGB offers lighting across multiple zones on the headset, and there are preloaded Play Mood animations. In case you'd rather create your own custom looks, you can use <a href=#>Logitech's G HUB software</a> to do exactly that.</p><p>Communication is key for certain games, so it's nice that Logitech has included a microphone and voice filters. That said, not everyone needs a microphone, so it's nice that the microphone is removable for those who don't want or need voice chat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you think the Logitech G735 is a good option for your Switch, but you're not happy with the price, don't worry. The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2</a> gaming headset offers similar connectivity with Bluetooth and a USB dongle for nearly half the price. The only problem is that it's a USB-A dongle, so you'll need an adapter to use with your Switch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-x-earbuds-tag.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Logitech G735 Wireless Gaming Headset</h5><span>Best Nintendo Switch Bluetooth Headphones Overall</span>$194 <span class=regular-price>$230</span> Save $36<p class=display-card-description>The Logitech G735 Wireless Gaming Headset supports Bluetooth for easy connectivity, but it's the included Lightspeed dongle that makes this the perfect headphones to use with your Nintendo Switch.

That's an essential feature if you're someone that commutes or travels with your Switch and don't want to miss things in your game due to surrounding noise. The Soundcores also have EQ settings available in a companion app on <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a> and <a href=#>iPhone</a>.</p><p>With 44 hours of battery life, the Soundcore Life Q30s ease the stress of having to charge your batteries constantly. This is a huge plus because the Nintendo Switch already needs frequent charging depending on your gaming habits, so having to fuss with yet another thing to charge can be a deal-breaker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Soundcore Life Q30 also has superb audio quality that brings in a punchy bass. The bass might not be for everyone, but if you're someone that wants cinematic-feeling audio, they'll sound great. They have a sound signature that, for many, will be easier to listen to for extended lengths of time too.</p><p>For their price, they're also comfortable, albeit a bit bulky in design. Audio leaking out from the headphones can also be an issue. If you're looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones that are surprisingly neck-and-neck with <a href=#>higher-priced competitors</a>, these are the ones to go with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1more-sonoflow.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless</h5><span>Best Budget Nintendo Switch Bluetooth Headphones</span>$56 <span class=regular-price>$80</span> Save $24<p class=display-card-description>The Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless are a comfortable set of headphones with noise cancellation and long battery life at a great price.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$56 at Amazon</a><h2 id=best-nintendo-switch-bluetooth-headphones-under-50-razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-x-earbuds>Best Nintendo Switch Bluetooth Headphones Under $50: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Razer Hammerhead True Wireless X Earbuds</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sony-wh-1000xm5-hanging-in-tree-3.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>â Bluetooth 5.s with auto-pairing</p></td><td><p>â Not noise-canceling</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>â Dedicated 60ms low-latency Gaming Mode</p></td><td><p>â Doesn't offer the best in-ear fit</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>â Mobile App customization</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>â Voice Assistant compatible</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>For less than $50, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Razer Hammerhead True Wireless X Earbuds</a> are a surprisingly feature-rich option for your Nintendo Switch. For starters, their 13-millimeter custom-tuned drivers deliver a satisfying wallop of bass, with clear highs and mids, for a well-rounded sound.</p><p>Bluetooth 5.2 with auto-pairing provides a stable and reliable connection and makes it convenient and fuss-free to use. Touch-enabled controls allow you to easily switch from in-game audio to voice calls, and they are compatible with your smartphone's voice assistant, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, if you're the kind of gamer who likes to tweak and twiddle with your sound settings, you'll you'll be pleased with the Razer Audio app on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>. This allows you to noodle with the EQ, remap touch gestures, and enjoy the benefit of regular firmware updates.</p><p>Most notably, these earbuds feature a 60ms low-latency Gaming Mode, which lends greater immersion to your game time, amplifying in-game sounds for a richer experience. A green backlit Razer logo on the charging case and earbuds lend a pleasing bit of swag to their appearance, and they will run for around 4 to 5 hours on a full charge, with another 16 hours or so provided by the case.</p><p>On the downside, there's no noise cancellation here, although this isn't too much of a shocker, given the price point. However, in every other respect, the Razer Hammerhead X Earbuds hit the spot. Excellent value for money, they make a great addition to your portable gaming experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sony-xm5.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Razer Hammerhead True Wireless X Earbuds</h5><span>Best Nintendo Switch Bluetooth Headphones Under $50</span><p class=display-card-description>With a dedicated low-latency Gaming Mode, Bluetooth 5.2 connection, and plenty of customization options via the Razer Audio app, Razer's Hammerhead True Wireless X Earbuds offer incredible value for less than $50.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$49 at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Walmart</a><h2 id=best-over-ear-nintendo-switch-bluetooth-headphones-1more-sonoflow>Best Over-Ear Nintendo Switch Bluetooth Headphones: <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">1MORE SonoFlow</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/puro-juniorjams.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>â Up to 70 hour battery life</p></td><td><p>â Noise cancellation isn't as good as more expensive headphones</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>â 5 minutes charging gets up to 5 hours playtime</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>â Wired mode for battery-free listening</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>â Comfortable for hours</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">1MORE SonoFlow</a> might be the company's first shot at wireless, noise canceling headphones, they're impressive, especially for the price.

You'll get up to 50 hours of playtime with noise canceling enabled, and up to 70 hours if you turn noise cancellation off. Even if you start to run out, a five-minute charge gets you up to five hours of listening.</p><p>What if the battery does happen to run out? As long as you've got the included 3.5mm cable with you, just plug it in and keep playing. The headphones work in wired mode without any battery at all.</p><p>If you're only using the SonoFlow with your Switch, you may appreciate the various EQ modes the headphones support.

The good news is that not only are the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> some of the best noise-cancelling headphones you can find for the switch, but they're <a href=#>one of the best, period</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because active noise cancellation (ANC) is the key aspect of this category, we'll look at that first. The XM5s feature eight mics for noise cancellation, and as <a href=#>we pointed out in our review</a>, the noise cancellation here is better than it was in previous models, and those already offered fantastic ANC. They're especially great at blocking wind noise, which is useful during calls.</p><p>Of course, the sound quality is important too. If you're going to spend money on headphones like these, you're likely using them for more than gaming. Positional audio in games is handled well, but the XM5s also handles music very well. In addition to standard Bluetooth codecs, these headphones support Sony's LDAC codec, which makes for higher-quality Bluetooth audio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Battery life is another key factor for gaming, and you can be certain that the headphones' battery will last significantly longer than your Switch's battery. Sony claims up to 30 hours of playback time, and this can extend up to 40 hours if you turn off noise cancellation.</p><p>On the rare occasion you want to plug the headphones into your Switch, the XM5s won't use any battery. Of course, you won't have noise cancellation in this mode, but it's nice to know that if you're on a long trip, the headphones don't become useless when the battery runs out.</p><p>The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are available in <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">black</a> and <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">silver</a> color varieties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Sony WH-1000XM5</h5><span>Best Noise-Cancelling Nintendo Switch Bluetooth Headphones</span>$328 <span class=regular-price>$400</span> Save $72<p class=display-card-description>The Sony WH-1000XM5 offer a combination of fantastic sound quality with some of the best active noise cancellation in headphones, period.

They have to be durable, and as easy to use as possible. As such, there's only one answer when you're looking for Switch headphonesâthe <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Puro JuniorJams</a>. Puro is already well-known for quality kids' headphones, and the JuniorJams are some of the best Bluetooth options they have to offer.</p><p>The JuniorJams are lightweight and have a long 22-hour battery life. This is achieved with an audio limiter that doesn't go above 85db, which means they can maintain consistent battery life. That limiter is also vital for <a href=#>protecting children's ears</a> from loud sounds. Other headphones don't include this, and it's a big reason why they made our list, even if it's a bit on the expensive side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The JuniorJams have great audio quality as well, maintaining crisp highs and solid bass.
