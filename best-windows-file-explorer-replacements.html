If you've never looked into what's available, you might be surprised. Here are the eleven best Windows File Explorer replacements.</p><h2 id=xyplorer>1. XYplorer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/xyplorer.png><p>XYplorer is one of the best Windows Explorer alternatives. But what makes it so good?</p><p>Firstly, it's portable. That means you don't need to worry about it not being available on other computers you have to use during the day. Just keep it loaded on your USB stick along with all your other <a href=#>useful portable apps</a>.</p><p>Secondly, it's got an impressive feature set that will appeal to both casual users and hardcore geeks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, the explorer has tabbed browsing. The tabs function like a web browser's tabs; you can reorder them, drag files between them, and pre-configure them. The app also boasts support for custom scripts, customizable fonts and colors, and secondary sorting.</p><p>XYplorer has both a free and paid version. The paid costs $39.95 for a lifetime license.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> XYplorer for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=directory-opus>2. Directory Opus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/directory-opus.png><p>If XYplorer doesn't meet your requirements, check out Directory Opus instead.</p><p>It arguably has a steeper learning curve than XYplorer. While the previous app takes many of its design cues from Windows File Explorer, Directory Opus introduces many of its own style decisions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're prepared to spend the time learning where to find everything, you will be handsomely rewarded. Features include support for synchronizing files and finding duplicates, scripting capabilities, graphics that allow you to flag and checkmark files, and a customizable status bar.</p><p>The lite version costs about $40 while the full version is $70. A 60-day free trial is available.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Directory Opus for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a></p><h2 id=fman>3. fman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fman.png><p>fman is the least Windows-like app on the list so far. It's self-described as "GoTo on steroids."</p><p>Perhaps the best thing about fman is its cross-platform support. It works on Mac and Linux as well as Windows. If you spend a lot of time jumping between the three operating systems, it'll provide a sense of continuity in your work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Best File Managers for Linux Power Users</a></span></p><p>Nonetheless, if you're a beginner, this probably isn't the app for you. fman is mainly aimed at software developers and other tech-savvy pros.</p><p>Feature-wise, it always displays the contents of two directories to make moving and copying files a breeze. It also has an extensive list of plugins for additional functionality, and it has full keyboard shortcut support.</p><p>It's free to download and use, but a full license costs $49.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> fman for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=free-commander>4. Free Commander</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/freecommande.png><p>Free Commander is the first entirely free software on this list. If you're not a power user and you don't want to pay for a Windows File Explorer replacement, this is probably the app for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The app doesn't try to confuse users with lots of features most people will probably never use. Rather, it aims to offer an alternative solution that remedies some of the glaring omissions within the native Windows app.</p><p>So, if you're a first-time user, what can you expect? Free Commander offers a tabbed interface, dual panels for easy drag-and-drop, built-in support for archive handling (ZIP files), folder synchronization, definable shortcuts, and even a DOS command line.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Free Commander for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=explorer>5. Explorer++</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/explorer.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second entirely free app on the list, Explorer++, makes the cut because it's open source. That means the community can keep working on it for as long as they wish---there's no danger you'll be tied to an unsupported app at some point in the future.</p><p>Interestingly, it's also one of the most basic apps on the list. It looks the most similar to Windows File Explorer and offers the fewest enhancements.</p><p>Despite that, the enhancements will lift most users to a new level of productivity. You will enjoy tabbed browsing, the ability to merge and split files, and a display window for file previews.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Explorer++ for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=altap-salamander>6. Altap Salamander</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/altap-670x472.png><p>Most of the apps we have shown you so far have focused on one computer. Altap Salamander is the first Windows File Explorer replacement that makes a big push to offer extensive networking tools.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Network protocols such as FTP, FTPS, SCP, and SFTP are all supported. It makes transferring files over the internet exceptionally straightforward.</p><p>The app also offers support for more archive file types than its rivals. It can work with ZIP, RAR, 7-Zip, ISO images, and UDF images.</p><p>Altap Salamander offers one other unique tool: a built-in password manager. It means you can protect sensitive or personal files using secure encryption techniques, thus stopping them from falling into the wrong hands.</p><p>It won't cost you a penny to try out this two-panel file manager as it's freeware.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong>Altap Salamander for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a></p><h2 id=tagspaces>7. TagSpaces</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TagSpaces is an open-source file organizer. It's seemingly targeted at light users and people who want to keep everything organized on their machine without using a full-featured file manager.</p><p>It works by adding user-defined tags to all your files. For example, you could tag things as "Photos," "Recipes," "College," and so on. You can color-coordinate your tags, then organize them thematically into groups for easy recall.</p><p>Best of all, because it works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android, you can stay coordinated regardless of which device you're working on. The app even boasts Chromecast support.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> TagSpaces for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a></p><h2 id=total-commander>8. Total Commander</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/total-commander.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Total Commander (formerly known as File Commander) is one of the most well-known Windows file managers. It has been around for more than 20 years.</p><p>It uses a split-pane view and allows you to compare files easily and sync directories. The app also offers separate trees, logging, enhanced overwrite dialogs, and custom columns.</p><p>Supported file types include ZIP, 7ZIP, ARJ, LZH, RAR, UC2, TAR, GZ, CAB, and ACE, and there's even a built-in FTP client with FXP and support for Unicode.</p><p>Other features include a quick view panel with a bitmap display, a tabbed interface, and support for parallel port links.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Total Commander for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a></p><h2 id=q-dir>9. Q-Dir</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/q-dir.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Q-Dir is another Windows File Explorer alternative that is worth considering.</p><p>The app's key feature is the four panes, each of which supports tabbed browsing. While four panes might be overkill for many users, if you spend a lot of time working with different files and folders, it can be a real-time saver.</p><p>Other features include color filters for files and folders, visible branch trees in directory folders, and full Unicode support.</p><p>Q-Dir is also exceptionally lightweight; it barely uses any system resources. If you have an older computer, it is a great choice.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Q-Dir for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=far-manager>10. Far Manager</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/far-manager.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Developed by the creator of the RAR file format and WinRAR file manager, FAR Manager is an open-source file manager for Windows PC. Itâs built as a clone of Norton Commander, and so brings with it that orthodox or retro look as well, as you can see from above.</p><p>To get started, download the MSI installer from the official Far Manager downloads section from below and finish the download.</p><p>Thatâs it. After the download and installation, launch the app and use it in place of your File Explorer. Far Manager supports a variety of file operations, such as copying, deleting, moving, and renaming your files and folders. It also offers features like file associations, search, and plugins, all of which combine well to make your searches pleasing.</p><p>So if youâre looking for that retro feel in your file manager (along with all the modern features), then Far Manager will an excellent replacement for your File Explorer on Windows.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong>Far Manager for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a> (Free)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=double-commander>11.

Based on Total Commander, the app very similar to its cousin but with one major differenceâit is entirely free and open-source.</p><p>It offers an internal text editor with syntax highlight, a built-in file viewer (that supports files in hex, binary, and text formats), and archives that are handled like subdirectories. The supported archive file types are ZIP, TAR, GZ, BZ2, XZ, LZMA, 7Z, RPM, CPIO, DEB, RAR, and ZIPX.</p><p>Double Commander is also a solid choice for anyone who does a lot of searching. The search function is powerful and will scan both files and their contents to provide you with a list of results.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> Double Commander for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=the-11-best-windows-10-file-explorer-and-manager>The 11 Best Windows 10 File Explorer and Manager</h2><p>Each app will appeal to a different type of user. People looking for a small amount of added functionality should consider Explorer++ or Free Commander. If you're a power user, check out XYplorer or Directory Opus.
