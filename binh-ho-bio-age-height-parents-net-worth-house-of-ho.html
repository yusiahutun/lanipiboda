They have built a multi-million dollar bank, a real estate development company, and a new generation of American Ho’s.”</p><p>Lionsgate SVP and Head of Unscripted Programming said then, “The Ho family is wildly engaging and we’re very excited to partner with HBO Max in bringing this hilarious and exuberant series to viewers”.</p><p>Binh Ho, the patriarch of the Ho family despite being super strict, has nothing but good intentions. Originally from Vietnam, his hard work paid off and he is now the owner of a successful bank.

After arriving in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas in Vietnam, he and his wife got sponsored to live in Kerrville, Texas. His first job in America was pumping gas at Exxon. Although life was hard for them, Binh was grateful that he was going to end up in a country where any one of his– his dreams could come true.</p><p>Not long after he learned the business and his wife who learned English, helped him grow the business. The family moved to Houston, Texas in 1977. There, Binh started selling insurance for a company called Washington National Life Insurance. The couple bought their first convenience store named Circle K convenience in the Fifth Ward and learned the English language from a woman who taught at Schreiner University.</p><p>Five years later, they bought and sold almost 100 similar businesses. It was then, that the family delved into the real estate business for the family.</p><p>Binh had a dream to open a bank because he felt there were a lot of Vietnamese refugees who weren’t as educated as him, and he wanted to share his knowledge of the American financial system. Once he created the bank, Binh felt like the legacy to help other Vietnamese or minorities learn about finance, learn how to borrow money, so that they could build and scale their businesses.</p><p>Speaking about Binh, his son Washington said in an interview, “Well, my, my parents are, they’ve always put, you know, there’s their faith number one, and their family number two. And what I see from my father’s leadership, him being a big brother, he always made sure that his family was taken care of— not just with food and water, but to put his family in the best position to succeed. Before he invested in any businesses, he always wanted to invest in his family first. And that means time.”</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Binh Ho Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>By 2022, Bih Ho’s estimated net worth was around $350 million.</p><h3><strong>Binh Ho Age</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, Binh Ho is 74 years old. 1948 marked the year Binh was born.</p><h3><strong>Who Were Binh Ho Parents?</strong></h3><p>Binh Ho came from a family of successful entrepreneurs.
