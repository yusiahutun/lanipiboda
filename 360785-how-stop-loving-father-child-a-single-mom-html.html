Your close friends and family should be your support system. Moving from loving the baby’s father to resenting him and maybe later thinking of getting back to him can be confusing.</p><h2>How to stop loving the father of your child</h2><p class=align-left>The following tips should help you stop loving the father of your child as a single mother:</p><h3>1. Don’t dwell on the past</h3><p class=align-left>Before going separate ways, you thought that you and the father of your child were a match made in heaven. You loved him with all your heart and even pictured a life together. He was the sweetest, took care of you, and also made you feel worthy. Something, however, happened along the way and by the time your child was born, the two of you were not seeing eye to eye.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to tell you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Thinking of the good times, you shared with your baby daddy can be hurtful. Dwelling on the past will only bring back memories that will not help the situation. You can let go of someone you love and have a child with no matter how sweet they were in the past. Think of the present and the role he has played in putting you in your current situation.</p><h3>2. Don't look desperate</h3><p class=align-left>That desperate look is ugly even for a successful woman. Do not make him think that you want him so much to the point of dropping everything you are doing when he calls. Make him know that you have options. You are young and beautiful. There are a ton of men who would kill to be with you.</p><p class=align-left>Appearing desperate for him when your child’s father has moved on will make him lose respect for you. Do not crave so much the traditional nuclear family. There is nothing you can do at this point. You tried, but it did not work. Forge forward and only focus on your child and career. He is doing the same.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Relationships you will encounter in your love life</p><h3>3. Start seeing other people</h3><p class=align-left>The relationship with your baby’s father failed. You probably tried rekindling the love so many times, but none of the things you did helped. It is not the end of the world. You can still see other people. And no, your child will not block any attempts you have at finding new love. So many single parents go-ahead to date other people after failed relationships.</p><p class=align-left>While out looking for your next partner, it fits not to hide that you have a child. Withholding the fact that you have a child from a potential partner may make everything backfire. Children are blessings, and if someone truly loves you, they will love your child as well. Introducing the fact that you have a child when you are too deep into the relationship may undo everything you have built.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6d7ce0f0a4347c04.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ rest in peace quotes for grandpa and grandma</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Best funny jokes to tell a girl you like</p><h3>4. Make peace with self</h3><p class=align-left>Making peace with ending a relationship with your child’s father may not be easy, but it is necessary. Accept what life has brought to you and move on. Try and find relaxation techniques that work for you as you embark on the journey of healing and acceptance. Denial is the biggest threat at this point.</p><p class=align-left>Do not be the baby mother who does not accept that things did not work with the baby daddy. Rise above the temptation to fight for the already broken love. It will do you right if you accept and let go. Do not overthink the situation as this may make you depressed. Accept and move on to other things that are happening in your life.</p><h3>5. Don’t view the kids as an extension of their dad</h3><p class=align-left>You sure love your child more than anything else in the world. This love should not be confused with the love you had for their father. Try and not look at your kid or kids as an extension of their father. They may have many physical features similar to their dad, but that does not mean that they are the same person.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/de691a5fa5cbc8a4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rest in peace messages and quotes to mourn loved ones</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Remember that the love you had for their father is no longer there for a reason. Let the children be their person. Love them unconditionally and give them everything a mother would give them. However, do not start seeing their father in them even if they display physical traits that remind you of their father.</p><h3>6. Enforce boundaries</h3><p class=align-left>The first thing you should do as you start co-parenting with the father of your baby is to set boundaries. Make him aware that even though you shared a life in the past and even made a baby, things have changed now. Think of how to break up with the father of your child without drama, talk about the appropriate time to meet, and who he can tag along when he comes to see his child.</p><p class=align-left>Tell him that he is not always free to stay in your house and if he does, he has to follow the ground rules. Create boundaries on how close the two of you can get. Having to co-parent with someone you no longer love or are trying to get over is no easy thing. Emotions may run high during one of the visits.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><h3>7. Think of the reasons that made you go separate ways</h3><p class=align-left>Did he cheat? Was he a perennial liar? Was he abusive? Did he manipulate you emotionally time and again? Think of the many reasons that made you end the relationship with the father of your child. The kid being in the picture is not a guarantee that this man will change his ways.</p><p class=align-left>Thinking of him in a positive light when he is still abusive will only hurt you in the end. You can work on an ideal co-parenting plan but not have thoughts of getting back together. He will still abuse you and disregard you even with the child present.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Girlfriend duties in a relationship: 15 things you are supposed to do</p><h3>8. Take the mixed signals as a no</h3><p class=align-left>Someone that shows you mixed signals is not right for you. One moment they feel you and the next they are too busy for you. They make promises and fulfil them for a week then completely forget about the promises they made the next day. Take this as a flag and flee. Going away is, however impossible if you share a child with this person.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 ways to win a girl who rejected you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>That is why it is prudent to take any mixed signals as a no and stop having any hopes of you two being an item. Make it clear that you do not appreciate how he fails to be straight-forward with you. Stand your ground and keep ignoring the father of your child if he fails to give you the full attention you need.</p><h3>9. Cut contacts with some of your mutual friends</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg><p class=align-left>Being in a relationship with someone means that you get to know some of their friends and they know some of yours. You also meet new friends when together. Having mutual friends can be a liability when a relationship goes south. Some of the friends you made while together are great company while others only make the situation difficult.</p><p class=align-left>Interacting with mutual friends may mean that the name of your baby daddy pops up once in a while in the conversations you have. This is not helpful for you as you are trying so hard to stop loving him. The mention of his name will only remind you of the past you want to forget. Cut off the friends you no longer want to associate with. It is healthy for your mental state.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/587017031e0f5b1e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to graduate from a side chick to main chick</span></p></a><h3>10. Think of yourself as the other woman</h3><p class=align-left>Your relationship perhaps failed because he was seeing another person. The pregnancy was probably unplanned. Whatever the reasons, think yourself as the other woman any time you entertain the thoughts of you and the father of your child getting back together. You do not stay together. The chances are that he is seeing one or more women wherever he lives.</p><p class=align-left>You surely do not want to be the other woman, especially when it comes to a man that sired your kid. This is one effective step on how to get your baby daddy out of your life romantically. Keep this in mind every time the two of you meet. It will help you discard any ideas of being the happy family you probably fantasize about.</p><h3>11. Be the fun mum, go out</h3><p class=align-left>A broken relationship with a child in the picture will have you hate yourself for a minute. You will think of all things that you did wrong and even try to fix them. You will cry for days, curse the day you met your baby’s father, swear to never get into another relationship, and think of every wild thing under the sun. This should not break you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs4fde3qus2l1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Types of relationships you will encounter in your love life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After you are done feeling sorry for yourself, get up, and face reality. Do not be holed up in your house like you are sick. Think of your baby’s interests and provide for them with all they need. When everything is taken care of, go out and have some fun. Go for girls’ night out, take yourself on dates, be a free bird, it will help you cope.</p><h3>12. Seek professional help if everything else fails</h3><p class=align-left>Therapists and counsellors are there for a reason. When everything else fails, take yourself to a professional for help. This is one of the best gifts you can give yourself. Therapists and counsellors are trained to understand your issues and will help you fix them.</p><p class=align-left>Remember to be open with them as they do not judge. They are there to help you. They listen, observe, take notes, and offer their wisdom. Want to know how to get over your baby daddy while pregnant? They will show you how. You can also join support groups in the community.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsh3j06p7a3g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>6 tips on how to get over someone you like fast</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What works for your friend may not work for you. Analyze your situation and learn how the baby daddy moves. The decision on how to stop loving the father of your child should come from within. Friends, society, the media, and other external factors should not influence you. Most importantly, choose you and focus on the well-being of your child. Keep in mind that children are keen and they can read the room. A mental breakdown from you can affect your child. Learn how to be strong for your baby. They need you more than anything else.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>Prayer for someone you love to come back</li><li>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlWlucW1dnby4edKtpqllnKTDqrrGZp2arJiav26vx6KjnWWRYsCqusalnGaln6J7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./scooter-braun-now-the-only-ceo-of-hybe-america.html>&#171;&nbsp;Scooter Braun Now the Only CEO of HYBE America</a>
