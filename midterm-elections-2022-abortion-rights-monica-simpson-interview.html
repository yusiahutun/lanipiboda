Voters in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a40360734/abortion-access-rights-california-bill-constitution/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=California class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">California</a>, Michigan, and Vermont enshrined the right to an abortion in their state constitutions. Even in traditionally conservative strongholds, people came out to rebuke stronger limitations to abortion access: Kentucky voters, for instance, rejected an amendment to their state constitution that would have stated explicitly that there is no legal right to an abortion, and in Montana, voters dismissed an initiative that would have placed felony criminal charges against health care providers who do not take "reasonable actions" to save an infant's life, even after an attempted abortion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The results are an eye-opening castigation of what many political pundits had projected to be a "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1135574613/biden-midterms-election-results-press-conference-live data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="red wave" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">red wave</a>." But, to Monica Simpson, the executive director of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sistersong.net/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=SisterSong class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">SisterSong</a>, it's just further proof of what reproductive justice advocates have long believed—that Americans across the political spectrum understand that a threat to our bodily autonomy is a threat to all of our basic rights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We can't do politics as usual," Simpson tells BAZAAR.com. "Finally, people are seeing that our democracy is at stake, and our issues around sexual and reproductive justice are at the core of this massive shift that we're in the midst of right now."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, an Atlanta-based organization that works to advance reproductive freedom across the nation, is one of many seismic forces that have helped move the goalpost in terms of how we speak and think about abortions during this electoral cycle. More than that, SisterSong is part of—as Simpson calls it—a body revolution. The collective takes on a multi-pronged approach to securing the right to bodily autonomy, ranging from legal action, as seen in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/georgia-abortion-providers-urge-court-block-six-week-abortion-ban-trial data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="their ongoing lawsuit" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">their ongoing lawsuit</a> against Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's so-called heartbeat bill, to partnerships that will help raise money for the organization, like their <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a41902495/the-every-body-campaign-beauty-products/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Every Body Campaign with Saie Beauty" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Every Body Campaign with Saie Beauty</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We have to build on those connections so that we ... can have more collective power to fight against these systems that are constantly trying to take us out and silo us," Simpson says. "They thrive off of us being in silos. White supremacy thrives off of us being in silos. And our silos are not going to save us."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, Simpson talks to BAZAAR about the 2022 midterm results, her message to Democrats, and the arduous fight ahead.</p><img alt="monica simpson speaks in microphone" title="monica simpson speaks in microphone" width=1600 height=1068 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss-sbm-73-1668187349.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of SisterSong</span><p>Monica Simpson</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong></strong><strong>So much of the focus in the lead up to the midterms concentrated on this projected red wave—but that didn’t necessarily materialize. How do you think abortion rights influenced voters during this election?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think that it's important to note that abortion was squarely on the ballot and that this was the first election since <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a39917317/post-roe-abortion-care-rlc/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the fall of Roe" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the fall of Roe</a>. All of that coming together really put our issues front and center and it made everybody have to contend with the issue—which, for us, that was already a win. Even though we were all sad and doing all that we can to restore what we need since the the fall of Roe, we know that the country needed to see where these candidates stood on this issue that impacts so many of our lives. That's just the main thing around this particular election, that it was squarely on the ballot in a way that we just have not seen. And I absolutely think that impacted the way the voters showed up at the polls.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What I found super interesting was that many exit polls found that some voters thought of abortion as a top priority, even beating out other issues like the economy. Abortion was a real priority for them.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You're absolutely right. Hopefully, what people are able to get from this is what we, as reproductive justice leaders, have been saying from the very beginning: Abortion has never for us been a single-issue lens. So, when people are voting for abortion, they're not just voting for abortion. They're voting for economic justice, they're voting for queer and trans liberation, they're voting for the environment. It goes across the board because this issue impacts our health, it impacts our ability to make our own decisions about our futures, it impacts families.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These election results show us that the people of America—in particular, those voters of color who continuously show up at the polls and vote for our values—understand that issues like abortion are not single-issue, and that we're going to vote in the way that ensures that we continue to have access to all that we need to be able to make our own decisions about our bodies and our future.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“When people are voting for abortion, they're not just voting for abortion. They're voting for economic justice, they're voting for queer and trans liberation, they're voting for the environment.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bodily autonomy is at the core of all of this. I think that that's what voters really are invested in. Whether it's dealing with the economy and being able to create the best life for you and your family, whether it is being able to walk freely down the street and not be concerned about police brutality, or queer trans folks being able to be free and to feel safe in this country—at the core of all of those issues is bodily autonomy. This shows us a really good picture as far as what the American people really want, and they want to be able to live in a country where their rights are seen as completely interconnected.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Voters motivated by abortion rights helped deliver some significant wins to the Democratic Party this year. What's your message to those Democrats who owe their victories to them?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We are counting on you to make good on your word. Long gone are the days for these politicians to say a thing to our communities to get the vote and then they get into these positions of power and they completely forget their base. We're holding them accountable. All of our eyes are on them because they made a clear message at where they stood on this issue and we're trusting them. So, we need them to make sure that they are making good on what they say that they're gonna do and we're gonna hold them accountable every single step of the way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think that we are at a place now where we're not just voting for people because we like them or because they've been in office forever and a day. We're voting for people who are actually going to do what they say they're going to do. And if they don't do that, then we have to make a different decision as voters. I think that that's becoming more and more clear for people, that we're actually gonna vote for people who are in alignment with our values, not people who are trying to hold on and continue the status quo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We talked about it so much in the media, from a racial reckoning to [being] in the middle of a body revolution. All of these things are happening and we can't do politics as usual. Finally, people are seeing that our democracy is at stake, and our issues around sexual and reproductive justice are at the core of this massive shift that we're in the midst of right now.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>While there's so much to celebrate in the midterms this year, there were still some losses to contend with, not least of which was Brian Kemp being reelected as Georgia's governor. What does his reelection signify to you? And what's next for SisterSong?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, we're gonna have to continue to be in the fight for our lives, considering the fact that we now have another term with Kemp. He's already moved an abortion ban. He's already publicly talked about coming for contraception. He is nowhere near where he needs to be on the fight for maternal health in our state and as maternal mortality is on the rise. He is just the opposite of everything that reproductive justice stands for. And so we're gonna have to contend with him and our state legislature to continue to be in deep defense mode, but also work really strategically around how we want to move proactively to get as much as we can to support our work in all the places that we can. So, this is gonna be all hands on deck for us in Georgia, which is not new to us, unfortunately. But it is gonna require deeper organizing, deeper collaborations for us to really contend with another Kemp term.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I know that SisterSong is still in the midst of an ongoing lawsuit against Kemp. How might his reelection shape the organization's next steps in terms of that lawsuit?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We're not going to stop until we win. We're committed to that and to making sure that we do everything to take this ban away in the state. I just think about the health and the safety of Georgians with Kemp being in office for a second term. I can't help but think about that. Judging by the ways that he has been moving as governor so far, he's shown us that he doesn't care about the lives of Georgians. If he did, how could he move an abortion ban into place where there were patients literally sitting in offices to get services that had to be turned away that day? I think that just speaks volumes to who he is and what he cares about and who he doesn't care about. So, I am extremely concerned about our health and safety in this state.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“We can't do politics as usual.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Georgia's position as a swing state and Kemp being reelected as governor—to me, it almost comes across as a warning of the possibility of what might happen to others, 'cause it doesn't just affect the people in Georgia.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Absolutely. I 100% agree with that, too.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>With election results like this, it can point to the power of the ballot box, but also its limits. What would you say are some actionable things people can do in between elections to fight for reproductive justice?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'll say this first—and we say this all the time—that policy and politics will not change until the culture changes. We are really committed at SisterSong to doing deep culture shift work to really educate more people, to bring more people into this work. We're meeting people where they are, 'cause everyone isn't directly connected to activist causes. I think this election day really held up a mirror to us, and I think all elections do that, right? To just get a really good understanding of our culture and where it stands in these fights against these different systems that we're up against.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“All of these movements have a direct connection to reproductive justice.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now that we have seen where things are and as we're even still waiting to hear for [more election results], people have to get connected to these [reproductive justice] organizations and the people doing the work. This is the time that people can use their social media, they can use their job platforms, if that's even possible. But, we have to literally use everything possible to educate people on these issues. Everyone can literally be an organizer by sharing their stories, by sharing information out to the people that they know and connect with. We all have to become organizers in this moment. We all have to do that work around continuing to destigmatize this issue so it doesn't become one of those wedge issues that politicians use it as sometimes. We need people to become organizers, we need them to get connected to us as members, as volunteers, as all the different ways possible to really build out this work and to build our collective power.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The other thing that people can do is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a39894060/donate-abortion-fund-roe-v-wade-help/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fund this movement" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">fund this movement</a>. Revolutions need funding, and we're in the midst of this body revolution. We gotta fund it. People can do that in small ways, like membership, and bigger ways, like becoming major donors. That's how we need to move in this moment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For some people, they may have directly had an abortion. For some folks, they may have supported people having an abortion. For some people, they may have given them money. For some folks, they may be helping a pregnant person through their pregnancy. All of us are connected to all of these different issues around this work. How does that look across this country? We wanna know. We have to know so that we can actually start to see ourselves reflected more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'll say one more thing. Whether you work in economic justice or voting rights or environmental justice, you gotta find your way. And we're here to help do that, to find your way to this movement. All of these movements have a direct connection to reproductive justice. I feel like reproductive justice is at the core of all justice work. We have to build on those connections so that we, again, can have more collective power to fight against these systems that are constantly trying to take us out and silo us. They thrive off of us being in silos. White supremacy thrives off of us being in silos. And our silos are not going to save us. We can't do this movement work from single issue lenses anymore. All of these issues have to be working together in order for us to see the changes that we need to see made in this country, in my humble opinion. <strong></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related:</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
