As one of the most influential lawyers today, Mary continues to shape her firm’s future, leaving an indelible mark on the legal profession.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Journey To Law</h2><p>Mary Stearns-Montgomery’s path did not always lead to the legal field. Initially, she had aspirations of becoming a social worker. She enrolled in a political science program at school, driven by her desire to make a difference in people’s lives. However, Mary’s life took an unexpected turn during her time in this program. She crossed paths with two remarkable women with a clear vision of becoming lawyers.

With a wealth of experiences, it was challenging to single out one, but one particular juncture stands out to her. Thirteen years ago, Mary made a significant shift in her legal career. For a quarter-century, she had been a dedicated family law attorney specializing in divorce and child custody cases. However, she made a surprising decision to step away from active legal practice to focus on building and managing her law firm.&nbsp;</p><p>But that would not have been possible without partners to care for the clients with the same attention to detail she demanded.&nbsp; Mary revels in the fortune bestowed upon her by the professional ethics and personal moral values of her partners and their hard work and support.

In her new role, she dedicated herself to growing the practice and nurturing the development of younger attorneys within her team.&nbsp;</p><p>This transformation from attorney to entrepreneur was a defining moment that reshaped Mary’s legal career, emphasizing her leadership, strategic skills, and legal expertise. As the Firm continued to thrive, Randy Sabatini pressed to head up a new location in Atlanta’s tech-focused suburb of Alpharetta, and in 2015, the Firm named him its newest partner.&nbsp; Not deterred by the chaos created by the pandemic, the partners worked tirelessly to continue to thrive and grow, with the newest partner, Melanie Prehodka, named in 2020 and spearheading the growth efforts to add the Canton, GA, location.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fostering A Just & Equitable Society</h2><p>Mary Stearns-Montgomery contemplates how the legal profession shapes a more just and equitable society.
