In the flick, Jennifer played Steve Stifler's mom who infamously had a sexual encounter with one of her son's classmates and, in turn, she got a lot of "action" off screen. Jennifer estimates she slept with 200 people after the movie wrapped.</p><p>"I got a lot of play at being a MILF and I got a lot of sexual action from 'American Pie.' There were so many benefits to doing that movie.

Gene explained that he snapped Polaroid photos with almost all of his partners through the years. He later ended up burning most of the pictures before he married his wife Shannon Tweed.</p><p>"I didn't do drugs in the crazy times but I did do sex. Did I sleep with 4,800 women? So they tell me.

Ten thousand women. I wish I hadn't said that because of my grandkids," Ric told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p><strong>12. John Oates</strong></p><p>Hall & Oates singer John Oates says that before he tied the knot with his wife Aimee in 1994, he believes he probably slept with thousands of women. He went on to explain that it was much easier at that time to have relationships with multiple women because there were no cell phones or the internet.</p><p>"I'm sure it was thousands…I've lost track. If you didn't live through the '70s and '80s, if you weren’t a rockstar during that time, there's no way you can comprehend what it was like. There were no cell phones and people taking pictures of everything you did. It was much more innocent. There was no social media. I used to meet girls in various towns and sort of have a relationship. I might see them and then see them six months later," John <a href=#>said</a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-8b66eb36-a00b-49db-8a76-92771aeb305f class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:8b66eb36-a00b-49db-8a76-92771aeb305f data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c6f378aa-bc27-4645-a727-176ac4bd4699 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8d/4by3/2022/08/08/8d6b0fd6819340a9b4bd60e81d4eabb3_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3FmamtfmLKtscGsZLCgn2K%2FpsLEmqOenF2dvLh5zJqlsmWgmryxuMRmq6Gdqauybr%2FLnqetZaeewal7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./black-sabbath-and-iron-maiden-together-on-ozzfest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Black Sabbath And Iron Maiden Together On Ozzfest</a>
