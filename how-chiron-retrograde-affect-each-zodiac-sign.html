The reclassification is more than fitting, as Chiron actually was the name of a famous centaur from Greek mythology. In fact, he was a teacher and a healer that taught great warriors like Jason and Achilles. However, despite being referred to as the “wisest and justest of all the centaurs” in Homer’s Iliad, the irony was that Chiron could not heal himself. He could share his knowledge with the greats and prepare them for surviving battle, but he could not heal himself after being accidentally wounded by his student Hercules, eventually giving up his immortality for the release of Prometheus.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p>The meaning of Chiron in astrology is directly tied to his influence on Greek mythology.
