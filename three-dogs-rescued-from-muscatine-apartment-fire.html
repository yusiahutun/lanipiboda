No injuries were reported and three dogs were rescued but residents were evacuated as a precaution during the investigation.</p><p>The Muscatine Joint Communications Center (MUSCOM) received a call of an automatic alarm for water flow of the sprinkler system at Harrison Lofts apartments, 1716 Bandag Drive, at approximately 9:38 a.m. Tuesday, Feb. 6, 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/02/Harrison-Lofts-fire.jpg><p>While fire crews were enroute to the scene, MUSCOM advised that a person there called to report smoke in the hallway of the third floor. The alarm response was upgraded to a structure fire response at that time, according to a Tuesday city release.</p><p>Upon arrival, the source of the fire was found to be in a third-floor apartment, but maintenance staff had used fire extinguishers to put the fire out. Fire department crews began evacuating the third floor, checked to make sure the fire was all the way out, and began to mitigate water from the sprinkler activation in the apartment that was empty at the time of the fire.</p><p>The fire activated one sprinkler head and contained the fire to the area of the stove and the cabinets above the stove.</p><p>The sprinkler was successful in keeping the fire from spreading either up or out beyond the immediate area, the release said. Smoke damage was limited to the kitchen area with some light smoke in the rest of the apartment.</p><p>Muscatine Fire officials stated that without the sprinkler activation, it is likely that the fire would have spread throughout the apartment and into the attic space prior to any notification outside of the apartment.</p><p>Three dogs were rescued from the apartment. There were no injuries to any civilian or emergency responders. Several people were temporarily displaced.</p><p>Fire department crews remained on scene until 11 a.m. assisting with water mitigation. Fire investigators were on scene for an additional hour. The initial cause is accidental in nature.</p><p>Direct fire damage is estimated at $5,000, and water damage is estimated at an additional $20,000. A damage mitigation crew was on scene prior to completion of the fire investigation.</p><p>The Muscatine Police Department and the Animal Control Officer responded to help with evacuation and ensure the safety of the pets from the apartment. The Muscatine Fire Department had 15 staff members who responded to the scene.</p><p>The Muscatine County Emergency Manager responded as well to assist with relocation efforts, along with the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army of Muscatine County.</p><p>Our Quad Cities News crew spoke with residents who live in the apartment building, and who were present in their homes during the fire.</p><p>“I was sleeping when this happened,” said Delilya Peniston, a Harrison Lofts resident. “The alarms woke me up. Me and my brother ran in the hallway and got the fire extinguishers and stuff and was just helping people out.”</p><p>At the time of the interview, Harrison Lofts residents were still processing the fire they just experienced.</p><p>“My dad is paralyzed,” Peniston said. “I thought my dad was literally going to die because the firefighters did not come up and help him. Me and my brothers, we had to get him out.”</p><p>Even neighbors who didn’t know each other helped each other out. “Everybody came out and helped,” said Aaliyah Peniston, a Harrison Lofts resident. “Everybody was crying. It was just chaotic.”</p><p>The Salvation Army, along with the American Red Cross in Muscatine, came to help families who lost their homes.</p><p>“There was about 10 to 14 families that were looking at being displaced,” said Lucas Gantner, a Muscatine County Salvation Army lieutenant. “If we’re local, with things kind of like this, we localize that section of the community, and then we will house them for Emergency Disaster Response in a local hotel.”</p><p>It’s not just housing that people need. “Every situation is unique,” Gantner said. “We’ve helped families say hey, let’s get you some clothes, let’s get you some needed hygiene items that are now gone.”</p><p>The Salvation Army says it will help families for however long they need it. “The Salvation Army has and always will be here,” Gantner said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKuhqpWaeqW7xqxkq52jmMKmsIyfqailXaLCtK%2FAraCnnV2WvaK%2B06acp6xdm7azsY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./494952-60-sigma-male-quotes-captions-photos.html>&#171;&nbsp;60+ best sigma male quotes and captions for your photos</a>
