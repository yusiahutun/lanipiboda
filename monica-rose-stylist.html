Not since Rachel Zoe in the mid-aughts has a celebrity stylist's particular fashion&nbsp;DNA been so recognizable. Rose&nbsp;favors&nbsp;monochromatic looks in white, black, gray, tan and the occasional red, plus&nbsp;signature pieces like the&nbsp;long dramatic&nbsp;coat,&nbsp;cropped top, leather and&nbsp;suede separates and delicate jewelry. The results are a band of beautiful minimalist glamazons whose style is slowly being copped by the masses.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">BAZAAR went to the source—Monica Rose's studio in West Hollywood—to see how this power stylist and mom dresses for&nbsp;her own life. First up, attending work meetings in vintage Levi's and a sweeping Balmain cardi, "I am such a tomboy," Rose explains, "Maybe that's why I style my clients so sexy—because I live vicariously through them." For Rose's default setting, "on the go," she&nbsp;favors jeans and a great leather jacket, "I live in my motorcycle jackets. I love my Laer brand one because of the leopard sleeves—it's all about the details." And lastly, when the stylist&nbsp;hits the event scene and the camera is turned on her. "I'm not a dress girl… I always think I'm going to wear one&nbsp;to an event, but I'll gravitate towards a sexy jumpsuit instead. I just feel good in it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">See Monica Rose's personal style below, get some trade secrets and, most importantly, take notes—this woman&nbsp;is influencing&nbsp;your closet and you don't even know it yet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Describe your style in 3 words.&nbsp;</strong>Effortless.

She always looked so chic and polished without even trying. I would always organize her closet and told her that she was not allowed to use wire hangers. I made her change all her hangers to the same color. I believe I was 5 or 6 years old. Another thing I would do is call my friends the night before school and tell them what to wear the next day. If they did not wear what I suggested, I would get upset and not speak to them for the entire day. It would really upset me because I just wanted them to look good and be put together. My friends' parents would get upset with me because I would cut their jeans to give them a cooler, edgier look. They would call my mom upset and told her that I needed to stop being so bossy and cutting their kid's wardrobe. Clearly, I was not a normal child— my mind was all about perfecting wardrobe vs. my studies.

At the time, I was working at a retail store on Robertson and knew that after working in retail for so many years I needed a change. I did everything I possibly could, from management to opening stores and working with a stylist in studio services and training sales associates. I would even help some clients organize their closets. I would do anything creative and productive just to keep myself busy. I just loved working one-on-one with my clients. I loved working with stylists that would come in and pull for different projects. &nbsp;Back then, not too many people knew about styling as an occupation— I didn't even know stylists existed before I moved to Los Angeles. Mind you, this was before social media and it was not public knowledge that celebrities were being styled all of the time. I was so fascinated by the idea and knew deep down in my heart I could do it, but I was so scared because I had no idea where to start.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>What's your approach when you first start styling someone? Do you ask questions, go through their closet?&nbsp;</strong>I meet with the client and from there we bounce ideas back and forth in terms of developing their signature aesthetic. Then, I go off to do more research and start curating a selection of garments and accessories that meet their needs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>The girls you style are often in dramatic coats, is that a personal signature of yours?&nbsp;</strong>I am all about a dramatic coat!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Do you generally style for day to day as well as events?&nbsp;</strong>I do both depending on how much my clients have going on. &nbsp;My clients get photographed as soon as they walk outside, so that's where the need for day-to-day styling originated. Plus, they film every day so that gives them very little time to dress themselves as they have extremely busy schedules. That's where I come into the picture.</p><img alt="Sleeve, Textile, Outerwear, Style, Pattern, Collar, Street fashion, Fashion, Blazer, Jacket, " title="Sleeve, Textile, Outerwear, Style, Pattern, Collar, Street fashion, Fashion, Blazer, Jacket, " width=1600 height=1066 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/08/1456250799-hbz-monicarose02.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Look Two: 'On the Go' wearing Laer Brand jacket; Alexander Wang tee; Citizens of Humanity jeans; YSL bag</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Who are some of your go-to designers for styling now?&nbsp;</strong>So many… It's crazy how many designers we work with. &nbsp;I love Sally Lapointe, Haider Ackerman, The Row, Unravel, Iro,&nbsp;Perfext&nbsp;...

We are glued to our phones and computers researching, calling in wardrobe and running around town to every showroom and store in LA. We are non-stop and there is so much preparation that is required beforehand. It can be very stressful at times. My team helps me so that I can run around to fittings with all of my girls. They are constantly sending me look books and pictures to preview so I can select the best of the best for my clients. I really count on them to be on top of everything 24/7. There is no room for error. The aftermath is a full time job returning and keeping track of all of the inventory. &nbsp;I like to be creative so the challenge is to constantly come up with new ideas while managing a business and a family. It's a lot and it can be very stressful at times, but I love what I do so much that I mange to make everything look easy, but it's not.</p><img alt="Clothing, Textile, Furniture, Couch, Style, Interior design, Natural material, Living room, Fashion, Animal product, " title="Clothing, Textile, Furniture, Couch, Style, Interior design, Natural material, Living room, Fashion, Animal product, " width=1600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/08/1456251048-hbz-monicarose05.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Look Three: 'Evening Out' wearing&nbsp;Self Portrait jumpsuit; Yves Salomon jacket; Sophia Webster shoes</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Are there certain types of looks the photograph best?&nbsp;</strong>Anything tailored to perfection!
